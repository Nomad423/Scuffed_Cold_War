 korean_war_devastation.1.d:0 "Hopes for the North Koreans that a Chinese intervention would lead to the unification of Korea appear dashed as UN forces have halted their advance. Unfortunately for the UN, they face a similar problem as efforts to counterattack continue to stall as the front appears increasingly static. So far, the introduction of new forces into the Korean War has not succeeded in turning the tide, whether the initial UN intervention or Chinese. The leadership of both sides continue to promise a breakthrough, however, as the front solidifies, the net result appears to be more violence and devastation brought upon the people of Korea and its cities."

 korean_war_devastation.2.d:0 "The United States initiated a massive bombing campaign targeting North Korea. The United Nations command stated the bombers were targeting North Korean supply lines and industrial centers. They were quick to emphasize the bombing is meant to halt the naked aggression of North Korea and prevent them from continuing offensive operations. The North Korean government in its own statement condemned the intense bombing, claiming it is indiscriminate and inflicting massive civilian casualties. The statement added the bombings are a sign of Western desperation and that the North Korean people will continue its sacred mission. The massive aerial bombing campaign marks a new escalation to the conflict in East Asia."
 korean_war_devastation.3.d:0 "The cowardly imperialist dogs have started indiscriminate bombing of our cities and roads. This is no doubt meant to shake the will of our people and maximize the spilling of innocent blood. However, they underestimate our resolve and instead of weakening the people it will only strengthen their devotion to complete the mission. Our military leaders warn the bombings will impact the supply of troops and production of arms, but promise the army of the people will continue to persevere. Our advisors on foreign affairs note the bombings indicate a desperation from the enemy and we must spread word of the blatant slaughter of our people to weaken their resolve."
