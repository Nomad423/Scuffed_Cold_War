 ALG_infantry_equipment_0_desc:0 "The MAS-36 is a bolt action rifle designed in 1927 chambered in 7.62x54mm French cartridge, and was adopted by the French military in 1936 as a replacement for the Berthier and Lebel service rifles. It saw service during the Second World War in limited numbers, but due to mass production after the war ended it would see service in numerous conflicts by many different nations. Post WWII produced rifles saw some upgrades in terms of ergonomics. It even saw some variants that saw the addition of an attachable rifle grenade and a marksman model. She was expected to only be an interim rifle, built on machinery that could be used to build anticipated self-loading rifles"

 ALG_infantry_equipment_1_desc:0 "The AK47 is a fully automatic assault rifle developed in the Soviet Union by Mikhail Kalashnikov in 1947, but was not introduced into active service until 1948 where the fixed-stock version was sent in for production. In early 1949, the AK47 was accepted by the Soviet Armed Forces for mass deployment into front-line units. With a long-stroke gas piston, a selector/safety, an automated trigger and chambering mechanism, and further improvements to overall design the AK47 was a vast upgrade to the SKS. The AK47 would, for many years, be considered to be one of the world's most reliable and easy to maintain, handle, and learn weapons in the world. "

 ALG_infantry_equipment_2_desc:0 "The AKM is a modernized variant of the AK47 that was developed by Mikhail Kalashnikov that was developed in the late 1950s and put into service with the Soviet Army in 1959. A great deal of the weapon was optimized and redesigned to suit the needs of the modernizing army. Many parts were simplified for mass production and the milled steel receiver was replaced with a u-shaped steel stamping to improve production rates. The weapon was also vastly lighter as a result of the simplifications reducing its weight. by ~30%. Additionally, the weapon was reinforced to make it stronger and added guide rails to improve the bolt carrier's movement. The AKM was immediately and ubiquitously used by many communist countries and manufactured for conflicts during its entire lifespan. Most notably the Invasion of Czechoslovakia, where it was used by both sides."

The engine itself is a 38.88 liter V-12 diesel engine and the tank uses torsion bar suspension and was capable of speeds up to 48 km/h.

Additionally, the T-55 used the 12.7 DShK HMG more often whereas the T-54 used the 7.62 SGMT gun, granting it more firepower but barring it from carrying more ammunition.

The gun and armor were still 125mm and composite respectively but with a vastly more economically feasible design that was easier to produce. The engine is a V-12 780 hp that could be later refitted with the a 1130 hp design. The tank could achieve incredible mobility achieving speeds of 80 km/h and could match harsher terrains better than the T-64. It saw usage in all soviet-sphere conflicts, unlike the T-64, and displayed incredible capability in them as well. The tank has also seen plenty of usage in out-of-sphere African, Middle Eastern, and Indochinese conflicts."

A section of the Korean-Chinese border was nicknamed MiG Alley because of their prevalence in the area. Over 18 000 MiG-15s were built and used by many nations, most notably the USSR and Eastern Bloc nations.

However, the MiG-17 primarily saw use in the Vietnam war with the NVAF and PLAAF were it scored 28 aerial victories.

 ALG_jet_recon_equipment_0_desc:0 "In April 25, 1950 the OKB MiG started development a MiG-15 front-line reconnaissance variant with an AFA-BA/40 camera, which provides a strip survey width from 0.9 to 4.5 km with the length of the photographing route from 90 to 450 km at altitudes from 2000 to 10000m. Only one NR-23 cannon was installed on the aircraft. To increase the scout's range, D4-50 locks were subsequently installed on the beams, allowing 600-liter fuel tanks of improved shape to be suspended under the wing. In addition, a transponder "Barium-M" and additional 2 liter oxygen cylinder was installed on the machine."
