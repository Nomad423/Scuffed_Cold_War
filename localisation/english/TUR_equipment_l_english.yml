It can be equipped with a single M2 Browning or dual M1919 Brownings. The M46 Patton uses a V12 twin-turbo engine that clocks up to 15-30 mph and has an operational range of 30-80 miles. It was heavily mass produced in an attempt to replace the former designs. It was in date with modern designs and weapons and did not suffer from heavy weight."

The engine is an optimized variant of the V12 used in prior Patton tanks with a light fuel injection system and is supercharged. It has an operation range off-road of 160 miles and 300 miles on-road. It can drive on road at 30 mph but clocks in at 20 mph off road due to the improved engine, transmission, and tracks. It served as the primary tank in the Vietnam war and was commonly used by the US's Cold War allies. It resembles the M47 Patton but is a completely new design with new internal mechanisms.

 TUR_scout_helicopter_equipment_2_desc:0 "Introduced in 1969 during the height of the Vietnam War, the OH-58 was a 4-seated helicopter whose noteworthy feature was that, despite having 2 pilots, the pilot controls on the left seat can be removed to carry a passenger up front. During the Vietnam War, its armament was a single M134 minigun or M129 Grenade Launcher. Post-war, the OH-58 would receive many modifications, with an engine upgrade (bringing it up to par with the later OH-58C), a thermal imaging system, a communications package for law enforcement, enhanced navigational equipment and high skid gear. These upgraded variants of the 'Kiowa' (named for a Native American tribe originally from Montana and Colorado) would take part in the Army National Guard's RAID Anti-Drug operations."

It came with features such as an upgraded transmission and engine for the chopper's nap-of-the-earth (extreme low level) flights, as well as a unique four-bladed main rotor configuration which allowed it to be much quieter than other helicopters, more so its predecessors. The OH-58D introduced the distinctive Mast-Mounted Sight (MMS) above the rotor system, and a mixed glass cockpit, with traditional instruments identified as "standby" for emergency use."

The main rotor is powered by two turboshaft engines that drive a single output shaft. Should one engine fail the remaining engine can deliver 671 kW (900 shp) for 30 minutes or 571 kW (765 shp) enabling the UH-1N to maintain cruise performance at maximum weight. It was also one of the few 'Iroquois' variants not to be used by the U.S. Army, instead being the standard-bearer for the Marines. Its twin-engine configuration gave it the informal nickname 'Twin Huey.'"
