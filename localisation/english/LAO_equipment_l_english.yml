Various Russian scientists and engineers were hired by the ministry and led by Captain Sergei Mosin and Leon Nagant to improve it and produced the Mosin Nagant after a long series of trials and prototypes. In 91, 1891, the bolt-action of Mosin's design was ordered into production. The rifle has a long disassembly time but is notable for its high accuracy.

In early 1949, the AK47 was accepted by the Soviet Armed Forces for mass deployment into front-line units. With a long-stroke gas piston, a selector/safety, an automated trigger and chambering mechanism, and further improvements to overall design the AK47 was a vast upgrade to the SKS. The AK47 would, for many years, be considered to be one of the world's most reliable and easy to maintain, handle, and learn weapons in the world."
