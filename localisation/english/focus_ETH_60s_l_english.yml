 newseth60.3.d:0 "This week, a surprised Haile Selassie was bombarded by over a hundred thousand fanatic Jamaicans pouring onto the tarmac, punctuating their welcome were ecstatic players of loud calabash drums with pungent clouds of cannabis smoke as he attempted to leave his airplane in Kingston international airport: voiding his planned ceremony for exiting the plane. His Imperial Majesty (now accompanied by prominent Rastafari figures) then continued his time in Jamaica by partaking in several ceremonies around the city; from a visit to the Prime Minister's palace to the receiving of an honorary doctorate at the University of the West Indies. However, the most momentous ceremony was that of his meeting with the the key figures of the Rastafari Cult, which will go down as a legendary event in history for the followers of the movement. Throughout the African diaspora in the West Indies the Rastafaris are now legitimized and taken seriously as their prophet, Haile Selassie showed them affection. Despite this literal worship of Haile Selassie by those who claim he is the second coming of Jesus Christ, his imperial majesty insisted to them that he is "an ordinary man", something that changed little in their mind."

 newseth60.2.d:0 "Today marked the formation of the OAU, the Organization of African Unity in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia along with its 32 signatory governments. The main objective of the formation was announced to bring the African nations together, and to bring total eradication of both colonialism and neo-colonialism within the continent. During the first conference which took place on the 1st of May, the leading Gambian nationalist Alieu Ebrima Cham Joof delivered a speech of heavy anti-colonization as he spoke, \"I therefore adjure that you ignore any suggestion outside Africa and holding that the present civilization, which some of the big powered are boasting of, sprang up from Africa, and realizing that the entire world has something earthly to learn from Africa.\" The world now awaits to see what this new union can bring to the continent."
 eth60.3.d:0 "Taking advantage of the Emperor's trip, this morning, a false emergency meeting was called where Ethiopian Coup plotters lead by the generals Mengistu Neway, Mulugeta Buli, and the local governor Garmame Neway took key figures such as Prime Minister Abbebe Aregai hostage."
 eth60.4.d:0 "The following hours have been brutal on these plotters as Mulugeta Buli tries to maintain the loyalty of the military forces to support the coup. The actions they take in securing this loyalty will decide the fate of Ethiopia forever"
 eth60.5.d:0 "The Prince Asfaw Wossen, son of Haile Selassie gave a controversial speech this week, from the usurper controlled capital. Punctuating the speech was a bold proclamation for the future of Ethiopia. Attacking the weaknesses and shortcomings of the government in addressing the issues plaguing the impoverished masses of the rural country. Claiming a bright future under a constitutional monarchy lead by the prince with a new cabinet of progressive figures where the common Ethiopian was no longer forgotten.

With many of the plotters dying in combat the two main organizers, the Neway brothers, in a last moment of cowardice killed their hostages including the Prime Minister and Italo-Ethiopian War veteran - Abebe Aregai. Surprisingly in their desperate attempt to escape the two killed their fellow plotter Mulugeti Bulli in a dispute. While able to flee the capital city initially Germame Neway and Mengistu Neway were found in a nearby town of Mojo. While Germame Neway committed suicide before his capture, Mengistu was taken alive and hung soon after."
 eth60.7.d:0 "The Prime Minister Abebe Aregai, though able to easily fool large Italian divisions in our nation's war a decade ago was not able workout his situation with the coup plotters and has been fully restrained in his hostage role.

While its unclear what exact change of administration the coup plotters will attempt at first, it is clear that country of Ethiopia will be drastically changed in the next decade for better or worst. While the student youth and intelligentsia are ecstatic, organizing mass celebrations throughout the main cities of Ethiopia, the rural nobility are slowly getting news of the coup and preparing for the worst. As the rural illiterate peasantry have no access to information outside of the estate they work on, their landlords are fearful of their future and will begin doing whatever they can to hold on to their feudal properties."
 eth60.9.d:0 "Envoys from Adis Abeba have repeatedly been bringing intimidating talks from the nation's administrators.

Famed as an Italo-Ethiopian war general who lead the Ethiopian expeditionaries in the Korean War has been in prominence in the new administration ever since the 1960 coup d'état.
