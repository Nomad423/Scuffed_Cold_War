For France to retain its independence and international standing, it must continue to avoid agreements which make it dependent or a junior partner. Although the United States and Britain will be disappointed, it is vital France looks after her own interests above all others, though we will maintain our partnership."

Initial reports suggest there will likely be a partition between the French and Algerians. However, the ceasefire news is being met with tentative optimism. There are growing rumors that the Pied Noir are greatly agitated by the news. They feel increasingly betrayed by the French government and there are fears a coup may be launched to derail any settlement in Algeria."

MTLD replaced the previous nationalist party after it was banned. Our intelligence reports the party has a lot of infighting, especially between moderates and extremists, perhaps a faction of the party orchestrated the attack. However, other sources suggest the attack may have originated from a new group seeking to establish itself. The investigation is ongoing."
 fra_crisis.1.crisis_end_well_desc:0 "The French public is largely supporting the government over its actions in the Suez Crisis. Many are lauding the French military for its professional, effective, and precise operations against the Egyptians. There is a feeling that France is removing the stain of its World War II defeat and is establishing itself as a world power. This despite international criticism over the action. The French public is accepting the reasons for the intervention and feel any opposition is rooted in an effort by the global community to keep France weak."
 fra_crisis.1.crisis_end_bad_desc:0 "There is widespread anger being directed at the French government following its failed Suez adventure. Opposition parties and other organizations are staging protests across the country while the media publishes negative editorials. Many in France feel the government plunged its military into an operation it was unprepared for and ended up humiliating France internationally. There is also accusations that the government had compromised on French interests or at worst let allowed itself be led astray by Israel and Britain."
 fra_crisis.2.bombing_sakiet_sidi_desc:0 "Reports from military commanders in Algeria indicate the ALN has escalated its raids from their safe havens in Tunisia. The rebels are also using the border and their ties with Tunisian sympathizers to flood Algeria and the FLN with weapons. Our forces are attempting to intercept these forces and arms, but the Tunisians are not helping. Diplomatic attempts with Tunisia are going no where and relations continue to deteriorate. The military wishes permission to launch an airstrike on the town of Sakiet Sidi Youssef. It is a major ALN staging ground and an effective strike could cripple their operations. However, if we give permission, it will likely trigger a strong Tunisian reaction."
 fra_crisis.3.bombing_sakiet_sidi_desc:0 "The Tunisian village of Sakiet Sidi Youssef was recently victimized by indiscriminate airstrikes from French planes based in Tunisia. The French claimed the village based a major ALN base and it had neutralized the rebels. The border between Algeria and Tunisia has seen a major escalation of clashes between the ALN and French forces. Despite French claims, the strike killed dozens, wounding many more, mostly civilians. The Tunisian people are furious and demand a response. The government is strongly being urged to cut off diplomatic ties with France, not doing so could cause an upheaval among the Tunisian people."
 fra_crisis.31.bombing_sakiet_sidi_desc:0 "The conflict between Algerian nationalist FLN fighters and French forces in Algeria escalated following news that French warplanes launched air strikes on the Tunisian border town of Sakiet Sidi Youssef. France has long accused Algerian rebels of using the Tunisian borderlands as staging grounds for its operations against French forces. They cite increased attacks in the area along with a dramatic rise in gun smuggling from Tunisia. The Tunisian government long resisted diplomatic pressure from France to address their security concerns and are infuriated by the bombing. Tunisian authorities report the bombing was indiscriminate, resulting in hundreds of civilian casualties. The casualties and blatant violation of national sovereignty are intolerable to the Tunisian people, and many wish an end to diplomatic ties with France."
 fra_crisis.4.motion_of_non_confidence_desc:0 "The National Assembly in Paris voted a motion of no-confidence, effectively ending the government of Prime Minister Felix Galliard. The young Prime Minister sought to build a centrist political alliance but these efforts were thwarted by the Algerian War. The French military recently launched air strikes against the Tunisian border village of Sakiet Sidi Youssef, allegedly targeting an FNL base. However, the large number of casualties, reportedly including many civilians, and the violation of Tunisian sovereignty has caused a major diplomatic crisis. The Tunisian authorities are rapidly removing French privileges in the country and many in France feel the government completely botched the situation and can no longer be trusted to govern. For many in France, the quick collapse of the Galliard government fits general political instability that has plagued the Fourth Republic."
 fra_crisis.5.motion_of_non_confidence_desc:0 "France is facing increased turmoil due to the unstable political scene and growing unrest in Algeria. The President Rene Coty has asked Rene Pleven and Georges Bidault to form governments, but both could not. With the civil order at risk, there is increased pressure for the President to find a new government quickly. However, the President appears unable or unwilling to take a more active role. The constitutional setup also limits his ability to act. With the situation appearing more dire, many French citizens are left wondering how the situation can be salvaged."
 fra_crisis.6.motion_of_non_confidence_desc:0 "The FLN announced it has executed French soldiers captured in its recent operations. The news has shocked and galvanized many in France. If the FLN expected the announcement would weaken French resolve they were gravely mistaken. The French military is already promising retribution and there are reports of Pied Noir militants are planning their own retribution on Algerians. The fighting in Algeria has reached a new level of notoriety. It appears the FLN action has only opened the door to more brutal fighting."
 fra_crisis.7.motion_of_non_confidence_desc:0 "Amid reports that Pierre Pflimlin was to form a new French government in Paris, French forces in Algeria staged a coup. Generals Jacques Massu and Raoul Salan led the coup, with Massu giving a speech announcing the coup leaders demands on the government. Massu called for a new Government of Public Safety under legendary French leader Charles de Gaulle. They want the new government to receive extraordinary powers to ensure Algeria is not abandoned. The French President Rene Coty is said to be stunned by the change of event as the new Prime Minister is finding his supporters quickly deserting him. The military response appears to be a response to concerns the new Prime Minister plans on negotiating a peace that hands over Algeria to the FLn."
 fra_crisis.8.motion_of_non_confidence_desc:0 "General Raoul Salan addressed the French people in a radio address from Algiers. The General confirmed he is in command of the new military government in Algeria. He reiterated the coup leaders demands that Charles de Gaulle be put in charge of a government with extra powers to ensure Algeria is not abandoned. Salan then addressed a large crowd from a balcony, leading chants of Viva de Gaulle. Two days later, French journalists interviewed Charles de Gaulle, who stated if called upon, he was ready to assume the powers of the Republic. The announcement has ignited concern across France that de Gaulle has possibly aligned himself with the military junta in Algeria." 
 fra_crisis.9.motion_of_non_confidence_desc:0 "Two days after causing public concern over his remarks regarding the coup in Algeria, famed French leader Charles de Gaull has held a press conference. He once again reiterated if the nation needed him, he would take responsibility. When a reporter questioned whether his assumption of power through military pressure would lead to a suppression of civil liberties, the French leader quickly responded. He stated, "Have I ever done that? Quite the opposite, I have reestablished them when they had disappeared. Who honestly believes that, at age 67, I would start a career as a dictator?" It is clear Charles de Gaulle believes himself ready to take power if needed."
 fra_crisis.10.motion_of_non_confidence_desc:0 "The Algerian Crisis has escalated as the junta in Algiers announced the formation of the Comite de Salut Public Algerie-Sahara. Junta leader General Raoul Salan stated the current Committee of Public Safety would now oversee all of Algeria and the Sahara. The coup leaders have now officially seized the territorial mandate of the French government in North Africa. It is now clear that the coup leaders are likely preparing to expand their operations to eventually expand their operations and mandate to mainland France."
 fra_crisis.11.motion_of_non_confidence_desc:0 "To increase pressure on Paris, elite French paratroopers from Algeria paradropped and seized Corsica. The operation is being called Resurrection. The paratroopers faced no resistance and took control of Corsica without any resistance. There are increasing concerns in Paris that the military contains many elements sympathetic to the Algiers Junta under General Raoul Salan. Following the successful operation, Salan released an ultimatum giving the government until the twenty-ninth to give Charles de Gaulle power. France appears to be on the brink of civil war."
 fra_crisis.12.motion_of_non_confidence_desc:0 "Charles de Gaulle met with Prime Minister Pierre Pflimlin to reach an agreement. However, the discussions completely failed to reach a resolution. It appears the two men could not see eye to eye on most issues, especially Algeria. The failure of the talks only escalates the crisis as it appears de Gaulle will not be able to work with the current government to resolve the conflict. The coup leaders in Algiers remain committed to its demand Charles de Gaulle take power. The more time which passes without a resolution increases the likelihood of a invasion from Algeria."
 fra_crisis.13.motion_of_non_confidence_desc:0 "Prime Minister Pierre Pflimlin and his government resigned amidst the crisis over the military coup in Algeria. The recent occupation of Corsica and subsequent ultimatum released by General Raoul Salan brought renewed pressure for the government to reach a resolution before civil war breaks out. Prime Minister Pflimlin, whose appointment caused the crisis, did try to reach an agreement with Charles de Gaulle, but those talks failed. With the deadline approaching, it is reported that pressure from the President Rene Coty persuaded the Prime Minister and his ministers to resign."
 fra_crisis.14.motion_of_non_confidence_desc:0 "President Rene Coty addressed the National Assembly in Paris. He laid out the predicament faced by the Republic, noting France stands on the brink of all-out civil war. He then urged the Assembly to put aside their difference and vote to appoint Charles de Gaulle as Prime Minister. He reminded the representatives that it was de Gaulle who restored liberty during the darkest hour of French history. de Gaulle and Coty then came to an agreement, that a new constitution, with a powerful executive, will be drafted and that de Gaulle shall receive extraordinary powers for the next six months. The National Assembly will vote in the coming days to approve Charles de Gaulle and his cabinet. President Coty indicated he would resign if de Gaulle is not approved."
 fra_crisis.141.motion_of_non_confidence_desc:0 "The French military in Algeria, led by General Raoul Salan, recently launched a coup in French North Africa, demanding Charles de Gaulle take over France. The action came out of growing frustration over the unstable political environment in Paris and fears the current government planned on negotiating an end to French rule in Algeria. The tensions were ramped up after the junta, in a bloodless airborne operation, captured Corsica. They then gave a deadline for de Gaulle to be appointed. For his part, Charles de Gaulle simply stated if the nation needed him, he was ready to act. As the deadline approached, President Rene Corty decided to appoint de Gaulle, threatening to resign if the National Assembly did not approve. Charles De Gaulle was subsequently elected, with a mandate to oversee a new constitution and six months of emergency powers to reform and restore national institutions."
 fra_crisis.15.motion_of_non_confidence_desc:0 "The first phase of Operation Resurrection proved a major success. Our paratroopers managed to successfully land and capture Corsica without any interference or resistance. Many in the military on the mainland support the cause, they strongly believe in preserving French Algeria, supporting nationalism, and a strong military. If the government refuses to implement our demand that Charles de Gaulle be given power or if de Gaulle asks for help, we will initiate the second phase of Operation Resurrection. With sympathizing military units in Paris, we can deploy over a thousand paratroopers to seize the capital and capture the government."
 fra_crisis.17.motion_of_non_confidence_desc:0 "The senior leaders of the Algiers Junta have been arrested following successful negotiations by the President. With a new, more stable government in power, information came that senior military commanders in Algeria planned on launching a coup to demand the return to power of Charles de Gaulle. However, with a compromise and stable government in Paris, the coup leaders lacked any justification or unrest to justify an action. This led to panic and betrayal, which allowed loyal military units to arrest the coup leaders. The path is now clear for the new government to enter negotiations with the FLN on a potential end to colonial rule in Algeria."
 fra_crisis.171.motion_of_non_confidence_desc:0 "A number of senior French commanders in Algeria were detained in Algiers. French authorities claim the officers were involved in a nationalist plot to use military power and overthrow civilian rule. The French President recently facilitated an agreement for a more stable government, with a strong mandate. This new regime exposed the coup plotters as the conspirators could not find a justification to act. This led to panic and betrayal, which allowed loyal military units to arrest the coup leaders. The path is now clear for the new government to enter negotiations with the FLN on a potential end to colonial rule in Algeria."

MAP is part of the Mutual Defense Assistance Act and allows the United States to provide military equipment to foreign partners in support of American interests. The military equipment provided does not need to be paid back. The act has become a cornerstone to American efforts at containing communist aggression globally. The French authorities argue it needs more support from MAP to strengthen its defense in the face of increased communist threats."
 fra_army.2.desc:0 "The United States accepted our request to increase the Mutual Assistance Program (MAP) funding for us. They recognize the vital role France plays in protecting democracy and Europe from destabilizing forces. Our military and defense officials will welcome the news as France desperately needs military support to meet current challenges and obligations. The MAP structure allows the United States to provide military equipment to allies without demanding these weapons must be paid for. It is a crucial tool for cooperation and also to contain the spread of communism globally."

 French_Communism.1.d:0 "It is clear communists have won the recent legislative election. This has caused a major political crisis as President Vincent Auriol announced his resignation. He refused to name a communist Prime Minister. Gaston Monnerville has assumed the Presidency, promising to hold fresh elections. The recent events have angered communist activists and political leaders who feel the will of the people is being suppressed. President Monnerville insists he will respect whichever party succeeds in the election."
 French_Communism.2.d:0 "The French communist PCF party issued a call for support from the Soviet Union. French communist leaders believe the government and military are actively resisting the will of the French people. This is a response to the decision made by the new President, Gaston Monnerville, to hold new elections. The decision came after his predecessor resigned after refusing to appoint a communist Prime Minister. The other French political parties are condemning the PCF decision, claiming the party should operate and trust the French Republic. A senior defense official privately told media members the nation will be at risk of Soviet interference."
 French_Communism.3.d:0 "The communist PCF party narrowly won a majority following new legislative elections. With their majority, the French President Gaston Monnerville dutifully carried out his function, allowing PCF leader Maurice Thorez to take charge of the government. Although many in France are publicly praising the transfer of power as evidence the Republic remains strong, there are fears Thorez may seek to transform the system. On the other side, PCF supporters are fearful that certain institutions, especially the military, may seek to overthrow the Republic and target the PCF. Tensions are heightened across the nation."
 French_Communism.4.d:0 "Several senior French military officers have privately reached out to us. They would like the United States to secretly provide war materials and support in case a civil war erupts. The French communist party recently won national elections and have formed a government. The military fears they plan on inviting the Soviet Union and destroy the French Republic. With our support, the French generals believe they can successfully protect France in case of a communist coup or Soviet invasion. Many in the Pentagon support the proposal, though there are some officials who warn if such arms transfers are discovered, it could greatly strengthen the PCF politically."
 French_Communism.5.d:0 "President Maurice Thorez provoked a major uproar in the National Assembly after appointing Jacques Duclos as Prime Minister. The decision caused the opposition to storm out of the National Assembly in protest. Many felt the appointment gave the communist too much power in the executive and it should have sought a more moderate choice for the Prime Minister. There were also protests in cities by anti-communist organizations who fear the PCF intends to transform France into a Soviet Republic. The President accused the opposition for disregarding the will of the French people."
 French_Communism.6.d:0 "In a stunning escalation to the brewing political crisis in Paris, legendary French leader Charles de Gaulle gave a speech calling for the resignation of President Maurice Thorez. In his remarks he condemned communism as incompatible with the Republic and French ideals. The comments are likely to galvanize anti-communist sentiment in the country. The strong outburst from de Gaulle confirms suspicions in the PCF that there is a vast conspiracy at play seeking to destabilize and remove them from power. The political atmosphere remains intense across France."
 French_Communism.7.d:0 "Reports from Algeria indicate there is a major mobilization of military forces in Algeria. The forces being mobilized are under the control of conservative nationalist General Raoul Salan. The Army movements are of great concern as it does not appear related to the current security environment in Algeria. The President and his senior officials must keep a close eye on the situation, as it could be the first step towards some sort of intervention by anti-communist elements in the military."
 French_Communism.8.d:0 "The communist government of France, led by the PCF is asking us for military support. The PCF fears the conservative French military appears poised to launch a coup against the government. PCF leaders feel even if the people support them, their lack of military personnel or equipment will ensure anti-revolutionary forces prevail. Protecting the French revolution could give us a strong foothold in Western Europe and the Atlantic. However, some officials believe involving our forces may only cause a massive NATO reaction and drain resources."
 French_Communism.9.d:0 "The Soviet Union agreed to offer its full support to the PCF government as it faces the risk of a revolt by the French Army. Many French military commanders and units are anti-communist and oppose the PCF regime. The French communists believe Soviet aid will protect their regime from a military takeover. For the Soviet authorities, backing the French government will showcase their commitment to international partners and provide an opportunity for the Soviets to establish themselves in Western Europe."
 French_Communism.10.d:0 "The United States clearly recently declared it remained committed to supporting "patriotic" French forces as they try to save their nation from a Soviet-puppet regime. French military propaganda calls Soviet involvement proof that the PCF intends to durn France into a Russian colony. The Soviet Union must determine if backing the French regime is worth risking a conflict with the United States or a protracted conflict in Western Europe. However, just as many Soviet officials believe the potential benefits outweigh any risks posed by American involvement."
 French_Communism.11.d:0 "The Soviet Union refused to backdown in the crisis in France, citing it will not betray its French comrades who are the only people keeping France safe from a military dictatorship. It announced a Soviet fleet has been dispatched to protect the French government from any illegal foreign or domestic operation. The French government released its own statement, stating it would welcome the Soviet fleet it had invited. This development raises concerns for the United States, as it must consider its options. Should it backdown, accepting the communist regime for now, or stay the course and support anti-communist military units."
 French_Communism.12.d:0 "French and Soviet officials are jubilant over reports that the United States will not actively involve itself in French affairs. The American government calculated the risks of an armed conflict with the Soviet Union was not worth backing anti-communist French military units. Although the Soviets and their French allies will be satisfied the situation in mainland France is calm, the colonies are another story. French military forces in North Africa have essentially separated themselves from the mainland and senior generals are promising that the French Army will one day return to liberate France."
 French_Communism.13.d:0 "The Soviet Union confirmed it would not be dispatching military forces to support the communist French government. Although no explanation was given, observers believe Soviet leaders determined it would be too difficult to subdue the anti-communist French military, especially if it was backed by the United States. With the evaporation of Soviet support, President Maurice Thorez has resigned. The highly respected Gaston Monnerville will assume the office until elections are led. This appointment will likely keep all political factions content until the next election. Many in France will eagerly await the new elections, with a hope that peace can return to the nation."
 french_elections.18.d:0 "The people of France recently went to the polls for the latest legislative election. Many hope a new legislature may help move the country beyond the recent political and international upheaval facing the nation. However, it is clear a National Assembly divided into multiple parties will be the result again, but which coalition has achieved a majority is unknown. The Republican Front, a coalition of socialist parties seem to be the likely winner if their parties achieved the majority. If they did not achieve a majority than it is likely the center right parties will be forming the ruling coalition. Citizens across France wait to hear the final results and future destiny of their nation."
 fra_crisis_2_desc:0 "The frequent political instability in Paris and lack of direction over the Algerian War has raised anxiety within the French military. Many officers fear the politicians are betraying French honor and letting the nation down. The more radical officers converged in Algeria and recently decided to act. News soon reached a stunned French government that French generals in Algeria seized power from the civilian authorities. The new junta calls itself the Committee of Public Safety. They have called for strong leadership and the return of French hero Charles de Gaulle. Days later French troops in Algeria seized Corsica to add pressure on the government. De Gaulle has only stated he would serve the nation if called upon by the government. The French government must now decide whether to bring back de Gaulle, accept the Committee of Public Safety takeover, or offer a compromise for Algeria."

Geneneral Challe gave himself up to the authorities, and was immediately transferred to metropolitan France. The putsch has been successfully quashed, but Article 16 granting full and extraordinary powers to de Gaulle will be maintained for five months. \"The Battle of the Transistors\" as it was called by the press was quickly and definitely won by de Gaulle."
 algeirs.1.d.alt:0 "The few military units which had followed the Government progressively surrendered. The Prime Minister Michel Debré gave himself up to the putschist, and was immediately transferred to Clairvaux Prison. The putsch has been successful, but the Communists opposition and Gaullist loyalists fell into clandestiny and started guerillas in metropolitan France. The Press was quickly shut down and the Martial law was extended to all France, the Fate of De Gaulle is still unknown"
 algeirs.1.a:0 "Ce qui est grave dans cette affaire, messieurs, c'est qu'elle n'est pas sérieuse."
 algeirs.1.b:0 "The Government forces are defeated and a new Military Junta will lead the country now"
 fra.15.d:0 "Philippe Pétain, a general and a Nazi collaborator has died today. He died on the Île d'Yeu yesterday morning, at the age of 95, and was buried in a Marine cemetery (Cimetière communal de Port-Joinville) near the prison."
 may.681.d:0 "Today far-right group Occident announced their intention to hold a meeting at the Nanterre Faculty, scheduled for May 3rd. In response, Maoist partisans aided by Anti-War activists occupied the Faculty."
 may.682.d:0 "Later today, the first of may defile will take place, called by the CGT, PCF and PSU sadly the CFDT, FGDS, and FEN refused to join the march. One notable event is the "22 of March Movement" cortege who clashed with the CGT."
 may.683.d:0 "Fires started at the occupied La Sorbonne. Rumors about the far-right group Occident going to attack the Maoist insurgent, communistic students contacted the workers to help them build barricades using a bulldozer. The police came to arrest the students, Nanterre was closed and the Prime Minister left for a diplomatic visit."
 may.684.d:0 "The riots expanded to the Quartier Latin. Multiple far-left organizations attended. Occident came to remove them but was pushed back. The Quartier Latin became a battlefield between police and communist students."
 referendumfr.2.d:0 "The Law on Connections (Loi sur les Apparentements) was a law passed in 1951 to counter Gaullist and Communist growing scores in legislatives elections. Combined, they represented up to 45% of the votes, and both aimed to block IVth Republic Legislation Process. Against this threat, the law stated that any list could connect itself with others; if the connected total score was above 50%, they would take all seats and distribute them between themselves. Since Gaullist or Communist wouldn't connect with anyone, they were assured to lose most of the constituencies."
 FRAPCF.1.d:0 "The government of France announced it officially acknowledges its historical role in the exploitation and oppression of the peoples in its Indochina colonies. However, the current government will not make the mistakes of the past or perpetuate the misery capitalism inflicts on people. The government has decided it will endorse all the liberation movements in Indochina and work to help these groups establish independent governments free of the influence of capitalist or imperial exploitation. This announcement by the French government is being cautiously welcomed in the French colonies and enthusiastically received among the urban intellectual classes of France.  However, among middle class and rural French, there has been a mixed reception as many in these communities view Indochina as part of the French global nation and believe it should remain French."
 FRAPCF.2.d:0 "With the Soviet Union increasingly showing repression and anti-democratic tendencies, many communists in Western Europe have grown increasingly alienated from it. In addition, the Soviet model increasingly appears alien to societies used to democratic approaches. These trends, along with a revision of Marxist theory has seen the emergence of Eurocommunism. Eurocommunism supports democratic institutions and encourages communist parties to ally with other groups to initiate largescale social reforms and achieve a democratic domination of society. The emphasis on the working class now expanded to include the middle class. Eurocommunism offers a new, democratic route towards socialism and communists who embrace it are also shifting away from the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union and traditional communists see Eurocommunism as a dangerous, revisionist route doomed for failure. However, for French communists, Eurocommunism offers a means to expand their base of support and demonstrate their independence within the global communist order."
 FRAPCF.3.d:0 "The French Communist Party has decided, after intense meetings, that France will embrace Anarchism. Anarchism will maintain a minimal state and ensure all citizens have absolute freedom. Free associations will likely begin to emerge, and France will soon be the freest nation on the planet. France will no longer be enslaved by the capitalist order as its people will no longer be controlled by state mechanisms. Many in France are connecting this new turn as a continuation of the anarchic experiments in Barcelona during the Spanish Civil War. Although those experiments were snuffed out, their legacy endures and now Anarchism will be the way of France. Neighboring states have expressed alarm and concern, though stating they will wait and see what Anarchism will entail. In capitals across Europe, crowds of anarchists took to the streets to celebrate the news from France."
 PCF_ALG.1.d:0 "The communist government in France declared the senseless violence, exploitation, and misery will end in Algeria. It has decided to grant Algeria independence and let it be run by its own people. The French government stated it was the capitalist system and imperialist pressures which has forced France to fight to control Algeria. Now that these pressures no longer influence the government, it is clear that the war in Algeria serves no greater purpose and must be brought to a just conclusion. Within France, the decision has a lot of support in urban areas but in rural France and among the middle class, there is a sense of betrayal. For them Algeria was never a colony, but an extension of the motherland and they see the government announcement as a betrayal not only of the nation but of the French population which currently lives in Algeria."
 ALG_CRACKDOWN.1.d:0 "The French government has already declared its opposition to decolonization with regards to Algeria. In their view, Algeria is not a colony, but a part of the French metropole and it must be preserved against barbaric and foreign ideologies. In support of this stance, the French government confirmed it had approved a new campaign to pacify Algeria. Media reports from Algeria indicate French forces have engaged in a widespread operation, utilizing aggressive search tactics, heavy weapons, and at times indiscriminate firing in order to uproot and crackdown on the independence movement. This new intensity to violence has encouraged many in France who believe the government should do whatever is necessary in order to resolve the crisis. However, there have also been protests to the brutality and internationally, many states have already expressed their concern over the disproportionate use of force being used by the French military."
 Petain.100.d:0 "Following the death of Philippe Petain, debate has emerged on where the former French General and President should be buried. Petain had been among the greatest French generals in World War I, leading French forces during the battle of Verdun. However, his legacy became controversial when during World War II he led the pro-Nazi French puppet government in Vichy. He is reviled by many but revered among many veterans and nationalists in France. After the war he was convicted for treason and spent the rest of his life in a prison cell on the Ile d'Yeu. Following his death, plans were made to bury him on the Ile d'Yeu but many French nationalists have demanded he be buried at the Douaumont Necropolis along with the French graves from Verdun. The French government must decide whether to bury him in the Ile d'Yeu or appease the nationalists and bury him in Verdun."
 AJAX.20.d:0 "Shah's unexpected return has been acclaimed by the Iranian people. In this time of need, they need a rock on which to hold on, and this rock might very well be the heir of a 2500 years dynasty!"

 ECSC.1.desc:0 "In France, Foreign Minister Robert Schuman has managed to secure support for the European Coal and Steel Community from many sections of the nation and non-communist parties. This idea has garnered support from ministerial colleagues, the President of the Foreign Relations Committee, and former Prime Minister Paul Reynard. How shall we choose?"
 ECSC.2.desc:0 "In West Germany, support for the ECSC has been mixed. The Social Democratic Party led by Kurt Schumacher has opposed the formation of it and the Federal Republic's ascession to the ECSC. However, the Minister-President of North Rhine-Westphalia where many coal and steel facilities are located has spoken in support of the ECSC. How shall we choose?"
 ECSC.3.desc:0 "Belgium is a major exporter of coal, having several large mines in the region of Wallonia. This will help our growing economy, but could be perceived as caving to other Western powers. Our workers may be happy, but our businessmen will not. How shall we choose?"
 ECSC.4.desc:0 "The Netherlands has large imports of agricultural products and industrial products. The ECSC will help our growing economy, but could be perceived as caving to other Western powers. Our workers may be happy, but our businessmen will not. How shall we choose?"

 ECSC.6.desc:0 "Italy is moving from a primarily agricultural nation to a rapidly growing industrial power with automobile and food production. The ECSC will help our growing economy, but could be perceived as caving to other Western powers. Our workers may be happy, but our businessmen will not. How shall we choose?"
 fra.16.d:0 "After the Communist Party took power in France, the Second Great Terror has been called, and purges are rampant all around France. Particular individuals such as known anti-communists, Nazi collaborators, and those critical of the regime. Some French diplomatic officials have turned to fleeing abroad or in Western-aligned embassies, while other officials are trying desperately to avoid arrest and imprisonment. The Red Wave has reentered France once again."
 fra.17.d:0 "After leaving NATO, and to the shock of neighboring Western powers, France has now announced its ascension to the Warsaw Pact, the Soviet communist defensive alliance. This is a major advantage to the Communist bloc, as France’s military is large and expansive; as well as strategically valuable, having France detached from the rest of the Eastern Bloc by being in Western Europe. This is certainly a development."
 fra.18.d:0 "Stalinism in France has been maintained as a core value of the PCF, and is led by Maurice Thorez. Revisionism, specifically ideas proffered by Nikita Khrushchev and Auguste Lecoeur, are not tolerated and are seen as bowing to the bourgeois imperialist Western Powers. These individuals simply cannot stand and the ideas of Stalin will live on in our socialist French paradise."
 fra.19.d:0 "Auguste Lecoeur, leader of the French Communist Party from 1942 to 1944, Member of Parliament and Mayor of Lens, has been sworn in as President of France. Known as a vocal opponent of Maurice Thorez and a supporter of Nikita Khrushchev and revisionism, it is expected that many reforms will come from his leadership."
 fra.22.d:0 "Reports from the Ministry of Defense indicate that our Communist French forces have annexed the Saarland border region of Germany, including forces marching into the largest city of Saarbrucken. Nominally, the Saar Protectorate has been French-operated since the end of the Second World War but out of fears that it would be taken by West Germany in the ensuing communist chaos, France directly annexed it."
