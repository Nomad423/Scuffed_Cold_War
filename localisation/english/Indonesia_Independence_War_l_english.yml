 Indonesian_National_Revolution.1.d:0 "The Dutch offensive from last year drove us into a guerrilla resistance on Java and Sumatra. International pressure forced them to return Yogyakarta and agree to negotiations. There is currently a ceasefire in place, though our forces are engaged in guerrilla operations. Our forces are slowly rebuilding themselves. We must determine how to approach the Dutch until a comprehensive ceasefire comes in place. Most of the commanders wish to maintain the guerilla campaign and hold out until the final peace. Other commanders argue we must change the conditions on the ground. They propose to take a month and re-organize some of our fighters into fighting units and launch offensives to force the Dutch out of Java and Sumatra to ensure we control peace talks. However, a failed offensive could be disastrous."
 Indonesian_National_Revolution.2.d:0 "The current military situation appears to be at a standstill. Our forces successfully recaptured key sites across Java and Sumatra last year during Operation Kraai, but international pressure forced us to make concessions, including returning Yogyakarta in exchange for agreeing to negotiate a settlement. It appears a more substantial ceasefire and negotiations will be coming in a matter of months to determine a final settlement. Our military officials have two plans, one is to prepare our forces for an offensive. Though this will result in international backlash and break the current ceasefire, it may be worth the cost. If our forces deliver a devastating defeat against the rebels, we control negotiations. However, a failed offensive would be disastrous. Another, more safe option, is to maintain control of the areas we have now and holdout until negotiations."
 Indonesian_National_Revolution.3.d:0 "Following Operation Kraai, the Netherlands was forced to halt its offensive, return the Republican capital of Yogyakarta and its government, in exchange for a ceasefire. With the Republican government expected to return soon and comprehensive negotiations expected to be held in a matter of months, the Dutch government has decided to withdraw all its citizens from Yogyakarta. Dutch military officials are urging its citizens not to delay, as the return of Republican authority in the area puts them at increased risk. As the Republican government remains in flux, they issued no statement on the issue."
 Indonesian_National_Revolution.4.d:0 "The Republican government has formally returned to power in its capital Yogyakarta. Many of its members had fled or were detained and exiled by the Dutch after its forces captured the city during Operation Kraai. However, following intense international pressure, they agreed to return the city and Republican leaders to facilitate talks, which are to be held soon. The arrival of famed Republican leader Sukarno brought most of the city residents to the streets as they celebrated his return. The Dutch had hoped its capture of senior political leaders would break military resistance, however, this was not the case. Despite the warm reception, there were reports that military commanders were refusing to accept the return of a civil government, accusing them of abandoning the revolution. However, the intervention of several senior commanders, including Colonel Suharto made sure the Republican military forces remain loyal to Sukarno."
 Indonesian_National_Revolution.5.d:0 "With the Republican government in power, efforts are being made to prepare for independence. One of the biggest issues is what a future Indonesian military will look like. After intense discussions, it was decided the Republican army would be the basis of a unified Indonesian military, with all other irregular or colonial forces integrated on those lines. Many observers note the decision might be an attempt by the government to mend fences with Republican military officers who just weeks ago refused to accept their authority. The conference also concluded any future independent government would be led by Sukarno."
 Indonesian_National_Revolution.6.d:0 "A roundtable conference will be held in the Netherlands later this month. For talks to occur, there must be a complete ceasefire in Java and Sumatra. After discussions, it was agreed that Java will have a ceasefire beginning on August 11 while Sumatra will start its ceasefire on August 12. Once all fighting has ended, there will be a process to oversee the transfer of military authority from Dutch and irregular Indonesian forces to Republican forces. The next few weeks and months will determine the destiny of Indonesia."
 Indonesian_National_Revolution.7.d:0 "The decision to integrate all military forces under Republican command has resulted in clashes across Indonesia. Some militias and irregular fighters have refused to stand down or follow directives. These clashes are so far localized but there are worries about what may happen when larger, pro-Dutch groups are asked to stand down. There is some concern that if such violence is not contained, it may derail the upcoming ceasefire. If the ceasefire does not come into force, the Netherlands may try to scuttle the roundtable meeting."
 Indonesian_National_Revolution.8.d:0 "Over the last two years of operations, the Dutch had re-established a presence in different areas of Java. In fact, their propaganda claims our forces are utterly defeated. With a ceasefire in Java only days away, our commanders want to launch one last assault on Surakarta. If we capture the city, it will greatly strengthen our negotiating position, at the very least we will show the enemy our resolve remains. It is a highly risky operation and will have to be ended by the ceasefire date. A decision must be made."
 Indonesian_National_Revolution.9.d:0 "Indonesian Republican forces infiltrated areas around Surakarta and are poised to launch an assault. Dutch forces and their local allies were unable to stop the rebel advance and are fortifying in the city center. The operation has occurred just days before a ceasefire on Java is expected to come in force. The Republican government dismissed accusations its offensive is a disruption to peace efforts, claiming its forces will comply with the ceasefire, when it comes into effect. The numbers of Republican forces involved are said to be in the hundreds."
 Indonesian_National_Revolution.10.d:0 "Our commanders in Surakarta have sent an urgent request for reinforcements. The rebel forces assaulting the city are reported to be infiltrating into the city, putting pressure on our defenses. There is a fear without reinforcements, the city may fall right before the ceasefire. We can dispatch several hundred RST commandos to bolster the defenses and halt the rebel advance. However, there is some concern if we rush forces and still lose the city, it may imply our forces cannot contain the rebel threat. Indeed, some military leaders feel the Surakarta command is being too cautious and deploying extra forces will only boost rebel propaganda."
 Indonesian_National_Revolution.11.d:0 "The timely deployment of RST commandos resulted in a route of Republican forces who were on the verge of capturing Surakarta. The Dutch are said to be thrilled that once again its forces triumphed in a conventional engagement against rebel fighters. However, the heavy fighting has exposed the false claims recently made by colonial officials that the rebel resistance had virtually ceased to exist. Despite the public praise for its forces, privately, many colonial officials are concerned that the regular forces were only able to beat off the rebel attack with the aid of elite forces. The Republican government praised the bravery of its fighters, saying it represents the peoples never ending devotion to a free Indonesia."
 Indonesian_National_Revolution.12.d:0 "Just hours before a ceasefire is to take place in Java, ahead of scheduled peace talks, Republican forces captured the symbolic and strategically vital city of Surakarta. Dutch forces failed to hold the city and ultimately withdrew, though the Republicans claim to have captured many prisoners. A Republican assault began just days ago, resulting in its forces rapidly putting Surakarta under siege. In the next few days, colonial resistance largely collapsed. Some observers believe the hit and run tactics adopted by Republican forces in Java sapped Dutch morale, leading to the quick collapse of resistance. There are rumors of arguments among Dutch military officials as there was not effort made to bring in reinforcements to the city. Analysts believe  the Republican victory gives them a commanding position for the peace talks in the Netherlands."
 Indonesian_National_Revolution.13.d:0 "A large protest of Dutch citizens, including many students marched in Amsterdam, protesting the ongoing colonial war in the Far East. The government is accused of sacrificing the economy, national honor, and international reputation of the Netherlands just for selfish colonial interests. The protestors also claim it is sick of constant lies being fed by the government. The recent uptake in violence in Indonesia is of particular concern to not only the protestors but also members of parliament. It now appears the tide is changing quite rapidly to the side of finding a peaceful but rapid withdrawal from the region."
 Indonesian_National_Revolution.14.d:0 "The people of Java can finally breathe a sigh of relief as a ceasefire comes into effect on the island. Colonial and Republican forces are reported to be ensuring the ceasefire conditions are met, both sides do not want upcoming peace talks to suffer any setbacks. Despite this, there are reports of some local irregular and militia forces resisting efforts by the Republican military to integrate them or disarm them. The Republican government is seeking to establish an organized, national military before the Dutch accept their independence. The Dutch forces will be happy to see an end to deadly hit and run attacks by Republican forces engaged in guerrilla war."
 Indonesian_National_Revolution.15.d:0 "The people of Sumatra can finally breathe a sigh of relief as a ceasefire comes into effect on the island. Colonial and Republican forces are reported to be ensuring the ceasefire conditions are met, both sides do not want upcoming peace talks to suffer any setbacks. Despite this, there are reports of some local irregular and militia forces resisting efforts by the Republican military to integrate them or disarm them. The Republican government is seeking to establish an organized, national military before the Dutch accept their independence."
 Indonesian_National_Revolution.16.d:0 "We recalled a number of our fighters and reorganized them into conventional, combat units. These will be essential for our new General Offensive, targeting the islands of Java and Sumatra. The planned escalation and current climate mean we must deliver a rapid, decisive blow to ensure dominance in future peace talks. The objectives of the Sumatra offensive are the cities of Jakarta and Surabaya. In Java, the cities of Palembang and Medan must be taken. By capturing these cities and maintaining control of the territory we currently control, the Dutch will have little bargaining power. We have two weeks to prepare."
 Indonesian_National_Revolution.17.d:0 "Our forces began taking offensive action against the colonizers. They are filled with a patriotic fervor. We plan to inflict such a blow that the enemy will have no choice but to make peace on just terms. For too long the enemy has sought to dictate the battlefield, but no more. Despite our preparations and devotion, the enemy is expected to resist fiercely. May this campaign be the culmination of all our struggles for freedom. The people of Java and Sumatra await freedom."
 Indonesian_National_Revolution.18.d:0 "The Republican rebel forces are launching offensives on Java and Sumatra. It is clear they are aiming to drive us out of these islands and secure a stronger negotiating position for potential peace talks. The rebels clearly wish to reverse the gains we made in our last major military operations, but they will not succeed. Our military forces are more trained, better equipped, and highly motivated. We are planning to not only blunt this dangerous rebel attack but if possible, push them back and drive them from their command centers in Yogyakarta and Bukitinggi."
 Indonesian_National_Revolution.19.d:0 "The General Offensive launched by the anti-colonial Republican forces in Indonesia has ended in a major victor for the group. Dutch colonial forces and their allies were forced out of key areas across the vital islands of Java and Sumatra. Many analysts believe this operation has greatly weakened Dutch resolve to keep fighting. More importantly, the Republican government is now poised to dominate planned peace talks. In addition to losing control of these key islands, many Dutch citizens are now in Republican controlled territory, along with a number of POWs."
 Indonesian_National_Revolution.20.d:0 "The General Offensive launched by the anti-colonial Republican forces in Indonesia ended inconclusively. Dutch colonial forces and their allies, despite some setbacks, did make some of their own gains. This successfully kept the Dutch in the region. The Republican government is praising its forces for their operations, though it is clear their main objectives were not achieved. Indeed, many in the government are likely to be breathing a sigh of relief that the Dutch could not launch a successful counterattack. Although the fighting was intense, both sides will now await a new ceasefire, before holding final negotiations. The Republican gamble on taking control of negotiations has failed for them."
 Indonesian_National_Revolution.21.d:0 "The General Offensive launched by anti-colonial Republican forces in Indonesia has ended in a complete failure. Dutch forces and their allies not only blunted the attack but also launched their own counterattacks, driving the Republic out of their major command and political centers. The Dutch military victory appears quite decisive on the battlefield. With its victory, the Netherlands will likely enter negotiations from a position of strength. Surviving Republican forces are said to be engaging in hit and run tactics. Negotiations are expected to begin in the coming months."
 Indonesian_National_Revolution.22.d:0 "With peace talks expected in a few months, we are preparing to launch one last offensive. Doing so could greatly strengthen our negotiating position and weaken the Republican government. We have justification, as the rebels continue to harass our forces, but cannot expect any international sympathy. As such, it must be a swift operation, and we must capture Yogyakarta and Bukitinggi. We expect to face stiff resistance. Despite these challenges, our forces are experienced, capable, and ready to execute the battle plan."
 Indonesian_National_Revolution.23.d:0 "The Netherlands confirmed its forces had launched a new "police action" to restore peace on Java and Sumatra. It noted that despite its concessions to the Republican government and international community, its forces continued to face violent attacks. The colonial forces are aiming to greatly weaken Republican military power ahead of peace talks expected in the coming months. The international community will likely strongly condemn the action. Analysts believe the Dutch believe a quick military success will lead to a favorable negotiation that will offset any potential international action. The fighting is centered in Java and Sumatra."
 Indonesian_National_Revolution.24.d:0 "Diplomats at the United Nation were quick to condemn the recent Dutch offensive on Java and Sumatra. Many claim the Dutch are pulling back on the assurances it made last year. There does not appear to be much sympathy to Dutch claims it was responding to Republican guerilla operations. There already is a draft being finalized on placing sanctions on the Netherlands, it is expected to be put to a vote soon. Analysts believe the Dutch were prepared for this diplomatic setback and will take their chances with a vote. Its leaders are gambling the benefits of a military success will outweigh the loss of international standing."
 Indonesian_National_Revolution.25.d:0 "A very confidant Dutch commander gave a press conference in which he unveiled all the prisoners and weapons captured during their recent offensive. Dutch forces and their colonial allies managed to seize the major political and command centers of the Republican government, effectively retaking control of Java and Sumatra. Alongside the military prisoners, a number of political leaders were also detained. Observers believe the Dutch victory will give it a much stronger position when negotiations take place in the coming months."
 Indonesian_National_Revolution.26.d:0 "After years of fighting, representatives of the Netherlands, Indonesian nationalist, and the Federal Consultative Assembly, representing Dutch-established states in Indonesia, are meeting in at the Hague. The United Nations Commission on Indonesia is facilitating the talks. The discussions are aimed at ensuring all outstanding issues between the Netherlands and Indonesia are resolved prior to the cession of sovereignty to an independent Indonesia. Although the nationalists hoped for a strong central government in support of national unity, before the conference they agreed to compromise with the Federal Consultative Assembly for a unified position on a future constitution."
 Indonesian_National_Revolution.27.d:0 "After discussions, the roundtable has agreed on the timetable of a Dutch military withdrawal from Indonesia. The colonial forces organized by the Dutch will standdown and either be demobilized or integrated into a new Indonesian military, with the Republican military forming the core. The Netherlands will be satisfied its forces will withdraw with full military honors, though there are many who feel the colonial forces are being abandoned. The Indonesian government will face a difficult task of integrating its forces. There are already fears among minority communities in Indonesia, who provided the bulk of the colonial military manpower, that they will lose employment and status with the Dutch withdrawal. The Dutch are to withdraw as quickly as possible."
 Indonesian_National_Revolution.28.d:0 "One of the major sticking points is the place of Dutch civilians and corporations in an independent Indonesia. These communities and businesses long enjoyed special privileges under the colonial regime. For many Indonesians, they remain an example of their second-class status. For many Dutch citizens in Indonesia, it is the only home they know, and many are not willing to leave. The Indonesian representatives agreed that there would be no discrimination against Dutch citizens or businesses, and it would honor all existing trade agreements. The major issue is the question of the debt accumulated by the colonial state, this will be dealt with later at the conference."
 Indonesian_National_Revolution.29.d:0 "The question of debt remained a major sticking point throughout the negotiations. The colonial administration accumulated both internal and external debts over a long period of time. Both sides presented their own calculations on what the debt is exactly and were in disagreement on what percentage Indonesia would be responsible for. In particular, the Netherlands are insistent Indonesia should be responsible for debts incurred after the Japanese occupation began in 1942. The Indonesians were furious of the prospect of paying for the Dutch military operations against its own people. The United States and UN were able to convince the Indonesians to accept responsibility for the debt as the price to pay for independence."
 Indonesian_National_Revolution.30.d:0 "Aside from the debt question, the status of West New Guinea has caused a number of heated exchanges. The Indonesians insist the territory should be handed over, but the Netherlands argues it is ethnically separate from the rest of Indonesia. The Dutch government quietly told the representatives that if the territory is conceded, it may not be able to get an agreement ratified by its parliament. The Indonesians, however, were not willing to withdraw its claims. Many fear the talks may deadlock on this sensitive issue."
 Indonesian_National_Revolution.31.d:0 "The Indonesian delegates agreed to ratify the Federal Constitution as the governing document for an independent United State of Indonesia. The principles for this document were agreed with before the talks by all Indonesian parties. The United States of Indonesia will be a federal government, with a bicameral parliament. The Republic and the Dutch-established states will be the constituent entities of the state, each receiving certain numbers of seats. Several autonomous states are also to be recognized. This constitution largely conforms to the demands of the Dutch states who fear an overly powerful central government could prove a problem down the road. The Indonesian nationalist, who favored a strong center, compromised heavily to ensure a united Indonesia. However, Indonesian nationalists will occupy the Presidency and Prime Minister."
 Indonesian_National_Revolution.32.d:0 "The last deadlock for a final agreement between the Netherlands and Indonesian representatives at the roundtable was finally resolved. The Indonesians agreed to allow the Dutch to control West New Guinea on the condition the two sides negotiate a final settlement within a year of independence. The compromise was made in the early morning after hours of intense discussion. Indonesian nationalists will not be happy but they at least received a promise of negotiations."
 Indonesian_National_Revolution.33.d:0 "Months of negotiations between Dutch and Indonesian representatives ended at the Ridderzaal. The negotiations were incredibly difficult and both sides were forced to make compromises. Representatives on both sides were reported to be fatigued but satisfied with the results. The Netherlands will feel satisfied it has left Indonesia with firm agreements protecting its interests. Indonesians will welcome an end to the war and recognition of its full sovereignty. Governments across the world are sending their congratulations for the birth of a new nation. The Dutch will now work to rapidly transfer sovereignty."
 Indonesian_National_Revolution.34.d:0 "As part of the transfer of sovereignty, the colonial authorities have released all Republican prisoners, both military and political. The prisoners are returning to their homes as national heroes of the Republic. All prisons are being transferred to Indonesian control. The release of prisoners will greatly aid the new state in establishing itself as many influential political leaders were among those held. The process of transferring sovereignty appears to be moving as smoothly as can be expected."
 Indonesian_National_Revolution.35.d:0 "The Netherlands officially transferred sovereignty to the United States of Indonesia. For the first time, all the people of Indonesia will be independent, united under one government. For many Indonesians, the years of struggle for freedom has finally ended. The United Nations released a statement on its anticipation of welcoming a new nation. The major embassies are already informing their intent to recognize the new government. Famed nationalist hero Sukarno is the new President for the nation while his political ally Mohammad Hatta will be the Prime Minister."
 Indonesian_National_Revolution.36.d:0 "In recent weeks, former Dutch commando Raymond Westerling announced the establishment of a movement called the Legion of Ratu Adil (APRA). The APRA, consisting of a diverse group, including former colonial soldiers, disgruntled Republican fighters, and Sundanese opposed to Javanese political domination. The group strongly opposes an independent Indonesia and sent an ultimatum calling for APRA to be named the official Army of the state and guarantees of autonomy for the federal states. The government did not respond and over the last few days, APRA forces attempted to launch a coup and seize both Bandung and Jakarta. The assault on Bandung was initially successful, but his forces failed to capture Jakarta or the government. Republican forces with police were able to swiftly restore order, though Westerling escaped to Singapore. Despite the Netherlands condemning the act, there are rumors they facilitated the escape of Westerling."
 Indonesian_National_Revolution.37.d:0 "In a sign of things to come, the parliament of Pasudan, one of the constituent elements of the United States of Indonesia, voted to dissolve itself and join the Republic. The parliament acted after facing intense internal pressure from its people. The vote came after revelations senior officials of the Pasudan government were involved in the recent coup attempt by the APRA. The revelations confirmed fears that the pro-Dutch elements in Indonesia are seeking to use the constitution, with its weak center, to divide and keep the nation weak. The decision greatly weakens the current federal structure and has slightly tilted the political balance in the national parliament."
 Indonesian_National_Revolution.38.d:0 "Sultan Abdul Hamid II, the ruler of Pontianak and member of the federal cabinet, has been arrested. The government revealed its interrogation of captured APRA members following their failed coup revealed the involvement of Abdul Hamid. Upon being questioned, the Sultan admitted his involvement, even revealing there had been an aborted second coup attempt in February. Sultan Abdul Hamid II strongly opposes the establishment of a unitary central government, fearing it would lead to the marginalization of non-Javanese Indonesians and had served as a senior officer in the colonial military. The arrest has sparked large protests in province of West Kalimantan as citizens want the state to join the Republic. The failed coup and subsequent revelations are confirming in the minds of many Indonesians that the current political structure is a colonial design meant to keep Indonesia weak."
 Indonesian_National_Revolution.39.d:0 "In light of the deteriorating political situation, the leaders of Maluku province have proclaimed their independence as the Republic of South Maluku. Armed supporters for the movement seized control of Ambon. Indonesian authorities report hit and run attacks occurring on Seram. The South Moluccan Protestants long served as the backbone of the colonial military. After independence, most decided against joining the Indonesian Army, fearing it as a Javanese Muslim dominated institution. The armed fighters who took Ambon are said to be colonial soldiers in the process of being demobilized. The Indonesian government has promised to swiftly restore order while accusing the Netherlands of allowing the former soldiers access to arms. The rebellion came about after news the new East Indonesia cabinet is considering to dissolve itself and join the Republic."
 Indonesian_National_Revolution.40.d:0 "Over the last two months, amid revelations regarding the January coup attempt and general discontent over the political situation, virtually all autonomous areas and states have voted to join the Republic. Only East Indonesia and East Sumatra remain. The leadership in both states strongly oppose a unitary central government, fearing it would lead to the political exclusion of non-Javanese and Muslims. However, the nationalist message of a unitary Indonesia to build a strong nation has strong resonance across large swathes of the population. There are reports of protests being held in the two states by citizens wanting to join the Republic. The Republican leaders state they only wish to support the will of the people."
 Indonesian_National_Revolution.51.d:0 "The United States of Indonesia is no more. The central government, the Republic, East Indonesia, and East Sumatra have all agreed to dissolve the constitution and replace it with a provisional constitution which promises a unitary state. Jakarta has been confirmed as the capital for this new state, the Republic of Indonesia. The announcements coincide with the fifth anniversary of the original proclamation of independence made by Sukarno. The announcement is being widely celebrated across the nation. The old system proved unpopular for most who felt it was a colonial-imposed system meant to keep Indonesians divided. Supporters of the United States of Indonesia were forced to backdown amidst rising public pressure."
 Indonesian_National_Revolution.41.d:0 "After intense discussions, the Indonesian government agreed to take on the debt accrued by the colonial state following the Japanese occupation of 1942. Although both sides presented their own figures on what the amount should be, it appears the Indonesians largely accepted the Dutch claims. The Indonesian delegates were said to be in a difficult position due to their weak position on the ground. In addition, the United Nations and American representatives pressed for an agreement, noting this was likely the price to pay for freedom."
 Indonesian_National_Revolution.42.d:0 "One of the early sticking points was West New Guinea. The Indonesian delegate argued it should inherit all the Dutch East Indies. The Netherlands noted the area was ethnically and religiously distinct from the rest of Indonesia. Both sides remained firm on their position, until an agreement was reached. The Indonesian delegates have accepted West New Guinea remaining a part of the Netherlands on the condition the Dutch promise to consider holding talks on the territory in the future. Observers note this is a soft agreement that leaves the Dutch plenty of room to simply delay discussions indefinitely."
 Indonesian_National_Revolution.43.d:0 "The Indonesian delegates agreed to ratify the Federal Constitution as the governing document for an independent United State of Indonesia. The principles for this document were agreed with before the talks by all Indonesian parties. The United States of Indonesia will be a federal government, with a bicameral parliament. The Republic and the Dutch-established states will be the constituent entities of the state, each receiving certain numbers of seats. Several autonomous states are also to be recognized. This constitution largely conforms to the demands of the Dutch states who fear an overly powerful central government could prove a problem down the road. The Indonesian nationalist, who favored a strong center, compromised heavily to ensure a united Indonesia. However, Indonesian nationalists will occupy the Presidency and Prime Minister."
 Indonesian_National_Revolution.44.d:0 "In recent weeks, former Dutch commando Raymond Westerling announced the establishment of a movement called the Legion of Ratu Adil (APRA). The APRA, consisting of a diverse group, including former colonial soldiers, disgruntled Republican fighters, and Sundanese opposed to Javanese political domination. The group strongly opposes a unitary Indonesia and sent an ultimatum calling for APRA to be named the official Army of the state and guarantees of autonomy for the federal states. The government did not respond and over the last few days, APRA forces attempted to launch a coup and seize both Bandung and Jakarta. Although Republican forces tried to intervene, the APRA succeeded in capturing the cabinet. Representatives who have links to the APRA have been called to help facilitate negotiations with the coup plotters. The nation holds its breath."
 Indonesian_National_Revolution.45.d:0 "Following tense negotiations, a breakthrough has been achieved. The APRA agreed to release its prisoners on the condition it would face no repercussions and a new cabinet of national unity is selected. The Republicans reluctantly agreed to allow Sultan Abdul Hamid II, the ruler of Pontianak and member of the federal cabinet, to take over as Prime Minister, while Sukarno remains President. The APRA fighters are currently withdrawing from the capital. Its success has inspired the establishment of APRA branches across eastern Indonesia, largely consisting of former colonial soldiers unhappy with the current military structure."
 Indonesian_National_Revolution.46.d:0 "Both the Netherlands and Indonesian delegates held strong opinions with regards to the debt incurred by the colonial state. The Indonesians firmly believed it was not obligated to pay for the expenses the Dutch incurred for waging war on the islands and exploiting its resources. The Netherlands feels Indonesians should shoulder some of the burden, especially from the period the Japanese began occupying the islands. After intense talks, the Dutch agreed to take the vast majority of the debt. Although they noted Indonesia agreed to shoulder some of the debt, most analysts believe this is just a paltry amount to help the Dutch save face. Rumors indicate the Dutch were forced to concede out of fear for its military and civilian personnel under Republican occupation."
 Indonesian_National_Revolution.47.d:0 "The Netherlands has agreed to hand over West New Guinea to Indonesia. Initially, the Dutch had resisted the demand, stating West New Guinea is ethnically and culturally distinct from the rest of Indonesia. However, the Indonesian delegates insisted it was to inherit all the Dutch East Indies. The main pressure came from Dutch citizens themselves as many strongly feel holding on to West New Guinea is not worth breaking the talks. Fearing public backlash, the Netherlands finally conceded to the nationalists. This is being viewed as another major success for the nationalists during these talks."
 Indonesian_National_Revolution.48.d:0 "The Indonesian delegates firmly agreed to adopt the 1945 State Constitution for the future Republic of Indonesia. The document is heavily inspired by the principles Sukarno has laid out as essential for an independent Indonesia. It is being viewed as a presidential system with parliamentarian characteristics. The Republicans were able to negotiate the acceptance of its documents after demonstrating its dominant military and political position on the island in the months before the roundtable. Observers note that although the document was accepted, there are many powerful Indonesians worried about an overly powerful central state and the domination of Javanese culture on all other islands."
 Indonesian_National_Revolution.49.d:0 "The Republican government, as per the process of transferring sovereignty, finally released the last batch of Dutch prisoners. A lot of these men were captured during the last phase before the final ceasefire. These prisoners were important bargaining tools in the roundtable conference. The process of transferring sovereignty continues unabated, although there are some incidents of unrest, especially in eastern islands where some complain their Dutch masters are only being replaced by Javanese masters. Regardless, Sukarno and Republican officials are continuing to call for national unity and cooperation."
 Indonesian_National_Revolution.50.d:0 "The Netherlands officially transferred sovereignty to the Republic of Indonesia. For the first time, all the people of Indonesia will be independent, united under one government. For many Indonesians, the years of struggle for freedom has finally ended. The United Nations released a statement on its anticipation of welcoming a new nation to its membership. The major embassies are already informing their intent to recognize the new government. Famed nationalist hero Sukarno is the new President and he has promised to tirelessly work for the betterment of all Indonesians."
