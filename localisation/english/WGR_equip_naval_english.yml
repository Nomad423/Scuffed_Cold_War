 WGR_sub_hull_small_single_0:0 "201 Class"
 WGR_sub_hull_small_single_0_desc:0 "The Type 201 was Germany's first U-boat class built after World War II. They were built out of amagnetic steel to counter the threat of magnetic naval mines, but the material had been insufficiently tested and proved to be problematic in service with the Bundesmarine."
 WGR_sub_hull_small_single_1:0 "205 Class"
 WGR_sub_hull_small_single_1_desc:0 "The Type 205 was a class of German diesel-electric submarines. They were single-hull vessels optimized for the use in the shallow Baltic Sea. The Type 205 is a direct evolution of the Type 201 class with lengthened hull, new machinery and sensors. The biggest difference though is that ST-52 steel is used for the pressure hull since the Type 201's non-magnetic steel proved to be problematic."
 WGR_sub_hull_small_single_2:0 "206A Class"
 WGR_sub_hull_small_single_2_desc:0 "The Type 206 is a class of diesel-electric submarines (U-boats) developed by Howaldtswerke-Deutsche Werft (HDW). Its design is based on the preceding Type 205 submarine class. These small and agile submarines were built during the Cold War to operate in the shallow Baltic Sea and attack Warsaw Pact shipping in the event of military confrontation."
 WGR_sub_hull_small_single_3:0 "212A Class Lot I"
 WGR_sub_hull_small_single_3_desc:0 "The German Type 212 class is a diesel-electric submarine developed by Howaldtswerke-Deutsche Werft AG (HDW) for the German and Italian navies. It features diesel propulsion and an additional air-independent propulsion (AIP) system using Siemens proton exchange membrane (PEM) compressed hydrogen fuel cells."
 WGR_sub_hull_small_single_4:0 "212A Class Lot II"
 WGR_sub_hull_small_single_4_desc:0 "The German Type 212 class is a diesel-electric submarine developed by Howaldtswerke-Deutsche Werft AG (HDW) for the German and Italian navies. It features diesel propulsion and an additional air-independent propulsion (AIP) system using Siemens proton exchange membrane (PEM) compressed hydrogen fuel cells."

 #WGR_sub_hull_large_single_0:0 "Type IX Class"
 #WGR_sub_hull_large_single_0_desc:0 "The Type IX U-boat was designed by Nazi Germany's Kriegsmarine in 1935 and 1936 as a large ocean-going submarine for sustained operations far from the home support facilities. Type IX boats were briefly used for patrols off the eastern United States in an attempt to disrupt the stream of troops and supplies bound for Europe. It was derived from the Type IA, and appeared in various sub-types."
 WGR_sub_hull_large_single_0:0 "Type XXI Class"
 WGR_sub_hull_large_single_0_desc:0 "Type XXI submarines were a class of German diesel–electric Elektroboot submarines designed during the Second World War. One hundred and eighteen were completed, with four being combat-ready. During the war only two were put into active service and went on patrols, but these were not used in combat."

 WGR_screen_hull_medium_1:0 "F120 Köln Class"
 WGR_screen_hull_medium_1_short:0 "F120 Koln"
 WGR_screen_hull_medium_1_desc:0 "The ships of the F120 Köln class of frigates were the first major warships built in Germany after World War II. They were the world's first ships to feature a combined diesel and gas propulsion system. The ships received numerous refits during their long careers with new electronics and torpedo tubes. They were replaced by Type 122 frigates in the 1980s and four ships were sold to the Turkish Navy. "
 WGR_screen_hull_medium_2:0 "F122 Bremen Class"
 WGR_screen_hull_medium_2_short:0 "F122 Bremen"
 WGR_screen_hull_medium_2_desc:0 "The eight F122 Bremen-class frigates of the German Navy are a series of frigates commissioned between 1982 and 1990. The design is based on the proven and robust Dutch Kortenaer class but uses a different propulsion system and hangar lay-out. "
 WGR_screen_hull_medium_3:0 "F123 Brandenburg Class"
 WGR_screen_hull_medium_3_short:0 "F123 Brandenburg"
 WGR_screen_hull_medium_3_desc:0 "The F123 Brandenburg class is a class of German frigate. They were ordered by the German Navy in June 1989 and completed and commissioned between 1994 and 1996, replacing the Hamburg-class destroyers. The ships primarily carry out anti-submarine warfare (ASW)."
 WGR_screen_hull_medium_4:0 "F124 Sachsen Class"
 WGR_screen_hull_medium_4_short:0 "F124 Sachsen"
 WGR_screen_hull_medium_4_desc:0 "The F124 Sachsen class is the German Navy's latest class of highly advanced air-defense frigates. The design of the Sachsen-class frigate is based on that of the F123 Brandenburg class but with enhanced stealth features designed to deceive an opponent's radar and acoustic sensors. The class incorporates an advanced multifunction radar APAR and a SMART-L long-range radar which is purported to be capable of detecting stealth aircraft and stealth missiles."

 WGR_screen_hull_heavy_0_desc:0 "The Type 119 Zerstörer 1 class was a class of 6 destroyers by the West German Navy. They entered service in 1958, with the last one being decommissioned in 1982. Since the time for planning, building and testing its own larger ships was not available, the Federal Republic of Germany received six destroyers of the Fletcher class for the German Navy from the USA from 1958 to 1960 as part of the Mutual Defense Assistant Act."
