 WGRElection.1.d:0 "The first West German federal election is a truly important moment. The two dominant parties, the conservative Christian Democratic Union led by Konrad Adenauer, and the social democrat Social Democratic Party led by Kurt Schumacher have the majority of the votes. A minority party still able to wield some influence is the Communist Party of Germany (KPD) rumored to have Soviet assistance. Who will win?"
 WGRElection.2.d:0 "The second West German federal election is a truly important moment. The two dominant parties, the conservative Christian Democratic Union led by Konrad Adenauer, and the social democrat Social Democratic Party led by Erich Ollenhauer and Egon Franke are duking it out for control of the Government. Who will win?"
 WGRElection.3.d:0 "The third West German federal election is a truly important moment. The two dominant parties, the conservative Christian Democratic Union led by Konrad Adenauer, and the social democrat Social Democratic Party led by Erich Ollenhauer and Egon Franke are duking it out for control of the Government. Who will win?"
 WGRElection.4.d:0 "After the five-year long military government, Germany is ready once more for a provisional election. With the fracturing of the SPD, the two competing parties are now the Christian Democratic Union led by Konrad Adenauer, and the German Party and Free Democratic Party coalition led by Heinrich Hellwege and Franz Blucher. Who will win?"
 Starting.1.d:0 "May 23, 1949 will be a momentous day for German history forever! Today, the work of the Parliamentary Council has come to reality as the Grundgesetz was signed and promulgated. Composed of members of West German state parliaments, the Council drafted the document and approved it, 53 votes to 12, on May 8. It was then put forth to state parliaments, being finally approved by all except the Bavarian Lander. This document, including the formation of the German federal government and providing crucial rights to all its citizens, marks the founding of the Federal Republic of Germany."
 Starting.2.d:0 "“(1) The Federal Republic of Germany is a democratic and social federal state.\n(2) All state authority emanates from the people. It shall be exercised by the people in elections and plebiscites and by means of separate legislative, executive, and judicial organs.\n(3) Legislation shall be limited by the constitution, the executive and the administration of justice by legislation and the law.”\n\nArticle 20 is one of the fundamental articles of the Basic Law, describing the governmental structure of the Federal Republic and guarantees democracy, republicanism, social responsibility and federalism, being more direct than the past Weimar Constitution. As well, Article 20 has the privilege of not being able to be removed from the Basic Law as it guarantees democracy for all."
 Starting.3.d:0 "“For the time being, this Basic Law shall apply in the territory of the Laender Baden, Bavaria, Bremen, Greater Berlin, Hamburg, Hesse, Lower Saxony, North Rhine-Westphalia, Rhineland-Palatinate, Schleswig-Holstein, Württemberg-Baden and Württemberg-Hohenzollern. It shall be put into force for other parts of Germany on their accession.”\n\nArticle 23 focuses on the German Lander, or states. The Lander have always had a large part in German unitary government, and this article provides other de jure German states, not included in the field of application of the Basic Law, to declare their accession, or Beitritt, at a later date. This is designed to give the Lander a fair opportunity to join the Federal Republic, assuming they are recognized by the federal government and declared their accession via free self-determination. This truly is a watershed moment for relations between the federal government and the Lander in German politics."
 Adenauer49.1.d:0 "The debate on the new capital for the Federal Republic is raging in the new Bundestag. Currently, the capital is located in the western city of Bonn, on the banks of the Rhine River. However, members of the SPD have argued for a relocation of the capital to the city of Frankfurt, arguing that the city already has the required facilities and that it would be 95 million marks cheaper. However, CDU members are pushing back, arguing that Bonn is the provisional capital and the capital should not be moved until all of Germany is reunited. Where shall the capital be?"
 Adenauer49.2.d:0 "“I am afraid that the Western Allies, instead of pursuing a European policy, are getting into a policy of interest which tends rather to prop up an authoritarian Adenauer regime than to allow it to be replaced by a democratic regime… What we have to debate and to vote on today is nothing but a test of whether the Basic Law is a scrap of paper and whether the majority can continue in its endeavors to ride roughshod over it…”\n\nThis brought applause from the SPD side, and interjections and boos from the CDU side of the Bundestag chamber. Herr Doktor Arndt of the SPD continued to speak.\n\n“We thought we were on the way to a parliamentary democracy and find ourselves on the way to a monarchy without a constitution... Herr Chancellor, we shall not let you forget this oath!”\n\nChancellor Adenauer rose to speak, noting that the trade unions of Germany were behind the government in their earnest desire to sign the Petersberg Agreement, even though it addressed dismantlement of industries. This prompted questions from the SPD opposition, questioning the validity of the claim. This debate continued to rage on, but a decision must be made, quickly."
 Adenauer49.3.d:0 "On 29 December 1948, the three Western Allies as well as the three Benelux countries issued the Ruhr Statute, a special system of ordering the workings of the Ruhr industry. The Ruhr Authority envisaged by the Statute, a body consisting of representatives of the six powers, was established on 28 April 1949, including provision for representatives of the Federal Republic as members of the Authority.\n\nThis prompted a clash of opinions between the Government and, above all, the Social Democratic opposition on a question closely connected with the problem of dismantling, namely that of recognizing the Ruhr Authority by sending a German representative. In practice the function of this Authority would amount to control of the entire German economy because of the overwhelming importance of the industrial area of the Ruhr for all economic life in Germany.\n\nIn a cabinet meeting, Chancellor Adenauer explained that participation in the Statute would have favorable consequences; if we refused, it would amount to obstruction, and therefore, a thaw in Allied relations.\n\nHowever, the other argument was that domestically, membership would not be popular and Government support would stumble, especially in Landtag elections in North Rhine-Westphalia. Which way shall Germany go?"
 Adenauer49.4.d:0 "To commemorate the new decade of the 1950s, Chancellor Adenauer addressed the collected Bundestag chamber, as well as high-ranking government officials in a New Year’s Address. Beginning after applause, mostly from the CDU side of the chamber, he began.\n\n “Ladies and Gentlemen of the Bundestag, Cabinet Ministers, foreign dignitaries and all those present, we are entering a new age. Less than a year ago, the Federal Republic was founded, and as we enter the 1950s, Germany will only grow more and more. Our relationships with the Western Powers only grow, while we pursue unification of Germany into one democratic state, not one controlled by one political party. As we enter a new age of technological development, Germany will be on the leading edge of this innovation, as we consolidate our limited industrial use for good. As I stand here, a testament to European democracy and peace is shown, and this shall continue forevermore!”"
 Adenauer49.5.d:0 "The reactions to German rearmament proposals by the Allies have been mixed within the Federal Republic’s government. The SPD’s position on German participation in a European defense community has been indeed hostile, with Dr. Schumacher considering CDU offers for rearmament to be premature, and is afraid that the Americans would make an offer that they could not keep. However, the CDU argues that the Soviet threat is large enough to warrant a rapid German rearmament, and that if they did not align with the Allies, the Federal Republic could be swept into the Soviet bloc, and would lose our sovereignty."
 Adenauer49.6.d:0 "Today is a momentous day in the Federal Republic’s history as the steelworks in the city of Salzgitter, known as the Salzgitter Works, were dismantled by German workers and observed by representatives from the three Allied powers. Formerly under the umbrella of Reichswerke Hermann Goering, the works helped to fuel the German war machine, especially in the production of panzer tanks, planes and weapons. After Allied capture, the works sat unused for years, until now. This is a major loss of German industry, but needed to remove a symbol of Nazi industry and dominance."
 Adenauer49.7.d:0 "Today, the German Government is proud to announce the official end of food rationing within the Federal Republic. Since the end of World War II, a rationing plan was put into place concerning all matters of consumables, including coal, eggs, meat, oil and potatoes. The Allies helped to supplement this, but we have finally reached the point where it is beneficial to stop rationing as we have an ample supply of food and other consumables."
 Adenauer49.8.d:0 "Today in the Bundestag yet another debate raged, this time about the Federal Republic’s possible accession to the Council of Europe. The CDU started, with Chancellor Adenauer speaking on the reasons why the Federal Republic should join; the willingness of other European governments to include Germany, especially the willingness of the French government and Foreign Minister Robert Schuman, and the benefits of entering into a union with other European democracies.\n\nThe SPD speakers countered, asking why the CDU insisted on this and urging delay until they could determine the real reasons why. The debate goes on, but we must make a decision soon."
 Adenauer49.9.d:0 "Today Chancellor Adenauer made a public announcement on all radio and television networks announcing a new decree. A resolution recently passed by the federal government concerning the constitutional loyalty of civil servants will go into effect; therefore, members of banned organizations cannot work in the federal government. Specifying that “persons in the service of the federal government must commit themselves to the democratic conception of the state through their entire conduct” and is directed towards 11 leftist organizations and 2 National Socialist organizations, including the Communist Party of Germany (KPD), the Free German Youth (FDJ), the Kulturbund and the Association of Victims of the Nazi Regime (VVN). Criticism for being authoritarian is bound to come soon, but this is needed for democracy."
 Adenauer49.10.d:0 "Unfortunate news has emerged from the Federal Chancellery. An undersecretary to Chancellor Konrad Adenauer, Hans Globke, has been implicated in past Nazi actions, including having been responsible for drafting the Enabling Act of 1933 which allowed Hitler to have dictatorial powers; as well as several of the Nuremburg Race Laws targeting Jews. Globke was never a member of the Nazi Party, but was intimately involved with anti-Semitic efforts. After the war, Globke was exonerated of any wrongdoing and served as a witness at the 1948 Ministries Trial, then being appointed by Adenauer in 1949. The Chancellor has decided not to fire him, out of respect, but is prepared to face immense criticism for Globke’s past."
 Adenauer49.11.d:0 "A new report landed on Chancellor Adenauer’s desk today. Titled the “Himmerod Memorandum” after its drafting location of Himmerod Abbey, it lays the foundation for the establishment of a new German military force, called the Bundeswehr. Key demands included the release of all German soldiers convicted as war criminals, the cessation of defamation of German soldiers, and measures to transform domestic and foreign public opinion of the German military. The group of German officers who drafted it, including Hans Speidel and Adolf Heusinger, hope that the Chancellor will accept their memorandum and begin discussions with the three Western powers to satisfy their requests."
 Adenauer49.12.d:0 "Landsberg Prison is an infamous penal facility in Bavaria, best known as the prison where Adolf Hitler was held after the failed Beer Hall Putsch, and where Mein Kampf was written. Used by the American powers during the occupation for holding war criminals, it was renamed to War Criminal Prison Nr. 1 in 1946. Over the time of its existence, Landsberg was used for nearly 300 executions of condemned war criminals. Now, it is still used to house war criminals but is under our jurisdiction. On one hand, the time is nigh to release them; the death penalty is abolished in the Federal Republic, but on the other hand, keeping them imprisoned will set an example to those seeking undemocratic forms of government. What shall we do?"
 Adenauer49.13.d:0 "Today the Chancellor’s plane from Germany landed in London, and with great fanfare, Chancellor Adenauer met Prime Minister Winston Churchill for the first time since a German head of government had touched British soil in 20 years. Remarking on common Anglo-German goals; the preservation of peace and the defense of the democratic order, Adenauer gave an assurance that Germany would prove itself a steadfast ally. Dissuading fears of German economic competition and renewed nationalist movements, Adenauer stressed the importance of Germany in the question of Europe and defense of democracy. This truly was a success for German foreign relations and Anglo-German relations!"  
 Adenauer49.14.d:0 "Interesting proposals have been received by the three Western Allies and the Federal Chancellery. Apparently, Soviet General Secretary Joseph Stalin has put forth proposals for German reunification, assuming that we are neutral and guarantee “the rights of man and basic freedoms”. Allied officials are suspicious that the “Stalin Notes” are simply a bluff for the Soviets to blame the Allies for a divided Germany. Chancellor Adenauer and the CDU characterize the notes as an aggressive action that attempts to stall the reintegration of West Germany into European politics, and even the SPD considers this a possibility. It seems clear that the government is united behind this, but a decision needs to be made, and soon."
 Adenauer49.15.d:0 "German-European integration continues today with the signing of the Bonn-Paris Conventions in Bonn between the three Western Allies and the Federal Republic. Important provisions include Article 1, which accords the Federal Republic “the full authority as a sovereign State over its internal and external affairs”, and Article 2, which provides that the Three Powers retain their rights concerning Berlin and all of Germany, including reunification and a peace settlement. This is a huge step for German sovereignty and European integration, and is only the first step in a long, long journey."
 Adenauer53.1.d:0 "With a victory in the 1953 election, Konrad Adenauer has retained his position as Chancellor of the Federal Republic. Beginning his second government with largely the same cabinet as before, Adenauer has announced his intention to hand off the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to a subordinate minister, at a date to be announced later. Additionally, it is expected that Theodor Heuss, current Federal President, is expected to remain in his position without much opposition. Political analysts domestically and abroad consider Adenauer’s continued leadership to be a benefit for West Germany and are expecting a continuation of greater economic and social rebuilding in the country."
 Adenauer53.2.d:0 "Nations around the world, particularly the three Western Allies, are outraged at talk of the release of the “Spandau Seven”; a group of Nazi war criminals interred in the Spandau Prison in Western Berlin including Albert Speer, Karl Donitz, and Rudolf Hess. After internal discussions in the Chancellery concerning the possible release of Konstantin von Neurath, former Foreign Minister of Germany and Erich Raeder, former Grand Admiral of the Kriegsmarine from Spandau, the Western Allies have largely condemned this action, but have not committed to any concrete action against it for the stability of the country."
 Adenauer53.3.d:0 "Celebrations abound in the Federal Republic today with the victory of the German national football team against the Hungarian “Golden Team” or “Mighty Magyars” in the final of the 1954 FIFA World Cup. Played at the Wankdorf Stadium in Bern, Switzerland, the Hungarian team was favored to win but was defeated. Considered one of the greatest matches in World Cup history, and known as the “Miracle of Bern”, this victory has allowed a sense of regained international recognition and popularity of the Federal Republic on the world stage, attempting to fix its public perception after the Second World War and denazification."
 Adenauer53.4.d:0 "Events recently of top-level officials in the German Government have come as a shock to both those at home and abroad. Otto John, the President of the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution; the Federal Republic’s domestic intelligence agency, disappeared in Berlin several days ago after attending a ceremony commemorating the anniversary of the July 20th plot against Hitler. Three days later, John appeared in communist East Berlin, disavowing his former country and criticizing Chancellor Adenauer’s policies of Western integration and remilitarization.\n\nThe German government has expressed outrage at this incident and are demanding his arrest and extradition from East Germany to our custody."
 Adenauer53.5.d:0 "A new foreign policy has been announced today at the Federal Chancellery. Named after State Secretary at the Foreign Office Walter Hallstein, the Hallstein Doctrine prescribes that the Federal Republic will not establish or maintain diplomatic relations with any state that recognized the German Democratic Republic, the illegal communist counterpart to our east. Based on the Soviet recognition of the GDR in March 1954, and our own recent agreements with the Soviets this year, we have the exclusive mandate to make this declaration based on the government’s right to represent the whole of Germany. This will for sure determine our future foreign policy, our outlook and standing on the world stage."
 Adenauer53.6.d:0 "Chancellor Adenauer returned from Moscow today, finishing a visit to the lion’s den for the West German government, and principally focusing on the return of the last German prisoners of war, a decade after the conclusion of the Second World War.\n\nTouching down in Moscow, Adenauer saw himself as an equal partner to the Russians, posing for a photo op with Soviet representative Nikolai Bulganin and General Secretary Nikita Khrushchev. However, negotiations stalled and threatened to dissolve, until the German and Soviet delegations attended a show of “Romeo and Juliet” at the Bolshoi Theater.\n\nTowards the end of the play, when the fathers embraced each other over the bodies of Romeo and Juliet, Adenauer and Bulganin stood up and embraced similarly, marking a poignant moment in the visit.\n\nSubsequent discussions proved fruitful, and agreements were reached; diplomatic relations with the Soviets, for the release of 10,000 POWs. Known as the “Homecoming of the Ten Thousand”, this success will forever be remembered in Germany, and beyond."
 Adenauer53.7.d:0 "It is official! With the ratification of the Paris Agreement on February 27, 1955, the Federal Republic of Germany is a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, the Western European mutual security alliance founded by the three Western Allies and nine other countries in 1949. After having signed the NATO troop statute and other agreements establishing the end of the occupation regime, a ceremony was held in Paris celebrating the Federal Republic’s accession, and maneuvers with NATO forces and the Bundeswehr are expected to begin next year. This addition to the alliance is guaranteed to anger the Soviets and set the line of conflict at the inner-German border, entering into a new age in this Cold War."
 Adenauer53.8.d:0 "Today was no normal meeting of the Chancellor’s Cabinet. A situation had developed in the Middle East, and Chancellor Adenauer felt that it warranted a response.\n\nAdenauer opened. “Herr Brentano, what does the Ministry of Foreign Affairs know?”\n\n“Mr. Chancellor, as you know, Egyptian President Nasser nationalized the Suez Canal on July 26. It’s been just over three months now, and we have been informed that those two countries have deployed paratroopers to seize the Suez Canal.”\n\nThis prompted a flurry of conversation from around the cabinet table.\n\nAdenauer spoke above them. “We must make a decision; whether to honor our friendship with Britain and France; or to speak out in support of Nasser, offering diplomatic support.”\n\nBrentano spoke again. “Going against the Allies, especially the French, may not be wise right now. We are still trying to consolidate our position on the world stage. However, pledging support for the United Nations effort currently may prove as a neutral position; supporting Nasser by default, without directly intervening.”\n\nAdenauer considered the options, then placed the matter up to a vote of the Cabinet. What will our position be?"
 Adenauer53.9.d:0 "Today in the Bundestag an important issue was being debated, one that could change the borders of the Federal Republic; the issue of the Saarland.\n\nFrom 1947 onwards, the Saarland was detached from the French occupation zone and enjoyed political autonomy as well as an economic community with France, but was still under the control of a French High Commissioner. The German government under Chancellor Adenauer has continued its efforts to end the special status of the Saar and annex it into the Federal Republic as a Lander. While some people in the Saar protest that they should be sovereign, the majority of the country considers the Saar to be a part of Germany, an important economic component, and a way to wrest control of the area from France. What shall they decide?"
 Adenauer53.10.d:0 "The tension in the air was thick as senior officers of the new German Bundeswehr entered the smoke-filled chambers of the NATO Military Committee session. They approached the table and sat, facing representatives from the other fourteen NATO members.\n\nThe chairman began. “Today we begin the first day of discussions concerning the deployment of NATO nuclear weapons on territory of the Federal Republic of Germany. We welcome our colleagues from the Bundeswehr to share their input.” There was general clapping and nods of approval all around, as some members continued to smoke intermittently.\n\nThe most senior Bundeswehr officer began to speak. “If I may be so bold, I’d like to thank the members of this committee for allowing us to speak today. However, I feel that the Bundeswehr, and the government of the Federal Republic at large, has concerns about the deployment of nuclear weapons on our territory. We are on the front-lines, the battleground-”\n\nThe American representative interrupted. “Exactly! Now that the Federal Republic has joined NATO, we should turn our attention to placing more nuclear weapons on German soil, thereby extending our range and making it easier to strike the Soviets should that be needed.”\n\nThe senior Bundeswehr officer looked visibly angry. “You see, that’s the problem. We are a new country, with a small and new military. If nuclear weapons are placed on our territory, it presents a threat to the Soviet Union and gives them even more of a reason to attack!”\n\nThe American delegate shot back. “But you see, Article 5 guarantees your security now. The filthy commies wouldn’t dare to attack us!” He was silently shushed by the committee chairman, who looked like he needed a stiff drink. “Perhaps we should deliberate on this issue in closed session.”"
 Adenauer53.11.d:0 "Today in Rome, the Federal Republic participated in signing the Treaty of Rome, also called the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community, and proposed the reduction of customs duties and establishment of a customs union, as well as the creation of a single economic market. More importantly, this treaty established the European Commission, what would be the executive branch of the European Union. Signed by Chancellor Konrad Adenauer and State Secretary of the Foreign Office Walter Hallstein, Germany’s participation in this organization will certainly be a benefit to all!"
 Adenauer53.12.d:0 "An important ruling has come down from on high, the Federal Constitutional Court, the supreme court of the land. In determining the legal status of West Berlin, continuing to be occupied by the three Western Allies; the Court has determined that the city is a state of the Federal Republic. Determining the city as an individual Lander provides its citizens rights under the Basic Law. This is an unexpected development, particularly with the three occupying authorities in Berlin; God knows the Soviets will consider this to be a publicity stunt, however."
 Adenauer57.1.d:0 "Today in the Bundestag a major portion of German reform has been passed with the success of the General Consequences of War Act. This act, designed to cover all claims and damages from actions of the former German Reich and transfer them to the Federal Republic, will ultimately prove to be helpful to war reconstruction not just in Germany, but around Europe where damage is done. This is generally recognized as the German government taking complete financial responsibility for the actions of their fascist predecessors and has received broad popular support from the Western Allies."
 Adenauer57.2.d:0 "Today in Ulm the Einsatzkommando, or Einsatzgruppen trial, concluded. Held in front of the Ulm Regional Court, the case surrounded ten members of the Gestapo, Sicherheitdienst, and Ordnungspolizei, who were part of the Tilsit Einsatzkommando during the period of National Socialism. According to a report by Walter Stahlecker, former Commander of Einsatzgruppe A, these ten individuals have been accused of killing over 5,000 Jewish men, women and children near the Lithuanian border during the war.\n\nConsidered the first turning point in the judicial fight against the legacy of National Socialism, all ten defendants were sentenced to between 3 and 15 years in prison for “complimentary murder”, and lost their civil rights for up to 10 years.\n\nThis case has had profound effects, with the founding of the Central Office of the State Administration for the Investigation of National Socialist Crimes to help begin the federal prosecution of all cases, allowing the Allies to see that the Federal Republic can police itself."
 Adenauer57.3.d:0 "On July 8, 1954, the Federal Republic of Germany was invited to the World Exhibition in Brussels, also known as Expo 58. Seeming politically sensitive, especially after Nazi Germany’s participation in the 1937 World Exhibition in Paris, this was a watershed moment for the Federal Republic.\n\nThe question of how the Federal Republic should present itself was hotly debated, with controversial debates being held in the Cabinet, until it was finally decided upon in 1956.\n\nThe German pavilion consisted of two stories, covered in glass, with a bridge allowing access over the Bundesautobahn 3. Fairly small compared to the larger US and Soviet pavilions, as well as the more infamous Belgian Congo pavilion, our contribution to Expo 58 represents a hopeful future for the Federal Republic."
 Adenauer57.4.d:0 "A new issue has reared its ugly head in the Bundestag. Ever since the Federal Republic’s accession into NATO and the meeting two years ago in front of the NATO Military Committee, the issue of nuclear weapons has haunted the federal government. Adenauer, and his cabinet, are in favor of NATO deploying nuclear weapons in the Federal Republic, as well as a possible independent nuclear program with France and Italy. However, the SPD has voiced numerous concerns to all aspects, starting with NATO deployment; considering it an overreach and a risk to the safety of not only German citizens, but possible reunification with the East.\n\nAdenauer’s Cabinet, in consultation with SPD members, has proposed a referendum concerning this issue so that the people can decide.\n\nHowever, the issue may be blocked by the Federal Constitutional Court, who has preemptively signaled that allowing nuclear weapons would be unconstitutional under Article 26 of the Basic Law.\n\nShall the referendum go on, reflecting the will of the people, or shall this issue be struck down, once and for all?"
 Adenauer57.5.d:0 "The referendum on nuclear weapons deployment has been held in all of the German federal states, on the order of the German federal government. Millions of eligible Germans lined up in their respective polling locations today, as the nation decided on the fate of NATO nuclear weapons deployment in the Federal Republic. While there has been little comment from NATO Headquarters in Brussels, it is expected that a public statement will follow the announcement of the results. What did the nation choose?"
 Adenauer57.6.d:0 "Yet another cabinet meeting was called today, this time in response to an issue raised by the German embassies in London, Paris, and Washington, concerning a Soviet note sent to the governments of the three latter countries.\n\nAdenauer was already seated, as was the rest of the cabinet, as the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Heinrich von Brentano, hurried in, hands full with briefing materials and printouts.\n\nAdenauer started. “Brentano, what’s the latest?”\n\nBrentano responded. “Chancellor, the Soviets have indicated…well, rather, demanded… that the Allies pull their troops out of West Berlin, and that the city be a Free City.”\n\nThis prompted a lot of vigorous discussion from the room, which Adenauer spoke over. “Well, I gather that this cabinet does not agree on most of those points, and therefore-”\n\nHe was cut off by a junior minister, the Minister of All-German Affairs. “Sir, maybe this wouldn’t be such a bad idea- Berlin could be free, and the Soviets might back off.” Brentano broke in again. “That’s a terrible idea. We should take a harder line against the Soviets- after all, what did we join NATO for?” Adenauer paused, thinking."
 Adenauer57.7.d:0 "The German federal government has come under renewed pressure by Western powers to recognize the Oder-Neisse Line, which is currently the border between the Polish People’s Republic and the German Democratic Republic, formed after the Potsdam Conference by the flow of the Oder and Neisse Rivers. While the Americans have especially pressured Adenauer and his cabinet to recognize the line via non-aggression pacts, segments of the German population, particularly the German expellee demographic, have realized his possible motives and are swinging into action against recognition of Poland. Shall the line be recognized?"
 Adenauer57.8.d:0 "It is with regret that Theodor Oberlander, former Minister for Displaced Persons, Refugees, and Victims of War, and member of the Bundestag, has been forced to retire from service with the government of the Federal Republic. With a report earlier this year, Oberlander has been implicated in promoting and committing war crimes in Poland during the Second World War, as well as endorsing ethnic cleansing in Poland, of the people that he soon came to lead as the leader of the All-German Bloc/League of Expellees and Deprived of Rights.\n\nIt is expected that the Adenauer cabinet will make a public statement on this, but will deny the accusations outright and wish Oberlander a safe retirement."
