#2021 Stalin Notes Rework
StalinNotes.1.d:0 "Soviet Premier Joseph Stalin revealed a plan for a solution to the Germany Question. The continued division of Germany and allied occupation risks the conversion of West Germany into a major military power for the West. East Germany at the moment lacks the manpower or industrial development of West Germany. The Soviet leader stated his intention to deliver a diplomatic note to the Western powers offering a peace conference to determine the unification of a democratic Germany, on the condition it remains completely neutral and with a minimum defense. This along with other conditions like the Potsdam border. A neutral Germany could become a key buffer state and deprive the West of a potential ally. However, before sending the note, the Soviets must decide if they can trust the West or Germany to follow treaty terms."
StalinNotes.2.d:0 "The Soviet Union recently dispatched a note calling for a peace conference between the occupying powers in Germany to work out the details of a unified, German state. The Soviets insist a unified Germany must be neutral, have Potsdam borders, among other conditions. The terms appear generous, and a neutral Germany could be a useful buffer. However, the democratic promises do not include a guarantee on free elections, also our allies believe Germany must participate after free, national elections. We should perhaps send a response detailing our views and call on further discussions with the Soviets over the issue, especially what strict neutrality even means. The Soviet offer could also just be a communist ploy, in that case it should be rejected outright."
StalinNotes.3.d:0 "The Western powers, predictably, by adding their own terms and conditions, specifically they want a UN supervised vote before the peace conference so Germany can participate. They have also expressed reservations about German neutrality, arguing it violates German sovereignty and oppose the Potsdam border as absolute. We must respond to this note and set our approach to engaging with the West in subsequent communication. One approach could be to concede to the Western conditions, except on neutrality. The other approach is to try and reach a compromise with the West over the issue. Finally, the Western resistance indicates they are likely to try and manipulate the outcome and we should just let this effort die."
StalinNotes.4.d:0 "We have exchanged further notes with the Soviet Union on the question of German unification. It appears the Soviets are willing to compromise and secure a genuine agreement. However, it is clear they will fight hard for their interests if we go this route. The other approach is to recognize the Soviet plan as a ploy to weaken Western Europe defense and if they are serious, they must accept our preconditions for talks entirely. Finally, if this whole exercise appears to be a propaganda ploy, we can end the discussions."
StalinNotes.5.d:0 "The Western powers continue to push back on our legitimate conditions for an acceptable, unified German states. Clearly their resistance to a democratic, neutral state reflects their dark ambition to turn Germany into a capitalist war machine. However, if we are confident the left can triumph in a national election before the conference, even with the pre-conditions met, the German state would work with us and we can turn the conference against them. If the risks are too high that the elections go for the right, we would risk losing all of Germany to the West."
StalinNotes.6.d:0 "Representatives from the Soviet Union, the United States, France, and Great Britain are meeting in a conference in Dresden to discuss German unification. The conference came about after the Soviet Union offered to hold a final peace conference to determine a solution to Germany. Many in the West are cautiously optimistic regarding the potential talks as the Soviets promised to respect democratic practices, including multiple political parties and individual rights. However, there are some concerns that the Soviets seek to establish a weak, German buffer state to protect its borders and weaken efforts to form a robust Western European defense."
StalinNotes.7.d:0 "The Allied powers and Soviet Union agreed to the formation of a unification government. The cabinet will be split between conservative and leftist politicians to for power sharing. A similar arrangement will be made for the German parliament. An equal political split ensures consensus is required to pass legislation and will keep political extremes at bay. There are grumblings in West Germany that the Allies are sacrificing democratic principles and empowering the communists who do not have that large of a popularity across Germany."
StalinNotes.8.d:0 "In one of the more contentious discussions, the four powers announced the new unified German state would geographically conform to the provisions of the Potsdam Conference. The agreement effectively shifts the eastern border to the Oder-Niesse line, giving up a large portion of the 1937 German border. West Germany long opposed this provision, however, the occupying powers agreed on it. An American diplomat privately told reporters the border was effectively already a reality and reversing it would bring too much disorder."
StalinNotes.9.d:0 "In a major breakthrough, the four occupying powers agreed a unified Germany would be strictly neutral internationally and democratic in character. Germany cannot join either Western or Eastern military alliances and is free to participate in any trade markets. In a compromise with the Americans, the new Germany is allowed to join the United Nations and participate, but will not be allowed to deploy military force or conduct actions against any of the occupying powers. The new Germany can also maintain a military, but only a force necessary for a reasonable defense and internal security. The Soviet Union insisted that no elections should be held to maintain the balance of power, however, the United States claims a democratic society requires elections. It was agreed the unification government will determine if elections are allowed."
StalinNotes.10.d:0 "In a landmark agreement, the United States, France, Great Britain, and the Soviet Union agreed to the final settlement on German unification. As per the agreement, West Germany and East Germany are to organize a new unification government to shepherd a united Germany. Germany is expected to remain strictly neutral, conform to the Potsdam borders, and guarantee democratic rights. Although many Germans welcome the news, there are concerns about the borders and the power of the communist party in the power-sharing agreement."
StalinNotes.11.d:0 "The United States, Britain, and France are insisting we form a unity government as envisioned in their agreement with the Soviet Union. Many in the country are angry Germans were not represented at the talks. In addition, the proposed state will have the controversial Potsdam borders and force us to work with the communist regime in East Germany, who do not recognize as legitimate. Our sympathizers in the United States quietly informed us if we refuse to create the unification government, they will support the nullifying of the treaty. However, there are also a lot of Germans who support the agreement, believing its benefits outweigh concerns over the borders and power sharing."
StalinNotes.12.d:0 "The West German government indicated its opposition to the recent agreement by the occupying powers over the unification of Germany. They cite the lack of any participation by an elected representative of the German people to be of principle concern. In addition, the conditions of a neutral state put the security and economic future of Germany at risk. More significantly, the unification government and lack of guarantee on free elections, even with a guarantee of democratic rights is unpalatable to the democratic people of Germany. The government added it does not recognize the illegal regime in East Germany and would not open any discussion with them. The United States has no choice but to withdraw support for the treaty and back West Germany."
StalinNotes.13.d:0 "The recent agreement regarding the unification with Germany appears to have failed. The government in West Germany refused to accept the terms of the treaty and will not meet with East German officials, who they do not recognize. Following this announcement, the United States, along with Britain and France announced they will not force West Germany to comply with the terms of the agreement. This effectively means all Soviet efforts to resolve the question of German unification have failed. The Soviets expressed their outrage and accuse the West of militarizing Europe. The Soviets are largely being praised for taking a stance on the issue while the United States faces criticism for negotiating an agreement, only to backtrack."
StalinNotes.14.d:0 "After tense discussions, officials from West and East Germany agreed on forming a unification government. Key cabinet positions will be split and seats from the parliament will be divided between the parties. A fifty-fifty balance between right- and left-wing parties will be established. This should ensure German neutrality and the threat of a strongman seizing power. The neutral German state received reports of the occupation troops beginning their withdrawal from the country. The first legislative debate is whether Germany should hold free elections in the future. A future constitution will determine the future makeup or electoral policies of the estate."
StalinNotes.15.d:0 "The agreement among the occupying powers stated that Germany would embrace democratic values, but free elections was left for the German government to decide. The Soviets opposed free elections, preferring instead a system where multiple parties received seats and could place whichever members, they want on them. Balancing the parties and ideology would preserve neutrality and free elections could destroy such a balance. The Western powers believe democratic rights are only effective if citizens have the right to vote. Voting allows the people to chose their representatives and punish leaders who fail. Parliament and the cabinet must decide on agreeing to future general elections or to keep the current government until a solution can be found later."
StalinNotes.16.d:0 "There is a feeling of immense excitement as UN observers begin setting up in cities across West Germany and East Germany. Both states will have national elections to establish a unity government before holding peace talks with the occupying powers to decide on the final unification of Germany. Soviet and Western military forces in the country are expected to remain in their barracks until the elections are held. This continues a peace process initiated by the Soviet Union to resolve the question of Germany."
StalinNotes.17.d:0 "For the first time in years, the people of Germany will go to the polls in a free election. All major political parties were allowed to campaign across West and East Germany. The polls will be overseen by United Nations members from many nations. Soviet, American, French, and British military forces are all in their barracks and military vehicles are banned from the streets for election day. Reporters from across the globe have arrived to see the historic elections. All of Europe appears to be holding its collective breath as they await the results."
StalinNotes.18.d:0 "United Nations organized elections across West and East Germany were completed peacefully. Millions of Germans went to the polls to determine the future of their nation. The elections are attracting intense international attention. For Europeans, the success of these polls and the new unity government will lead Germany in peace negotiations with the occupying powers. The UN plans on releasing the results once all the votes are calculated. The Soviet Union and United States are being praised for their initiative and respect of the polls."
StalinNotes.19.d:0 "The United Nations recently declared the leftist coalition, led by the communist Socialist Unity Party of Germany won the election. It will lead the German delegation for peace talks. The results surprised the United States and its European allies who thought the party would not be able to compete effectively across Germany. The Soviet Union is praising the result as an indication of the German desire for peace through socialism. Many analysts believe this will shift the advantage at the Peace Conference for German Unification in favor of the Soviet positions."
StalinNotes.21.d:0 "The current Peace Conference on the Unification of Germany reached an agreement on the borders for Germany. The Soviet and German government both agreed on respecting the borders established by the Potsdam Declaration. Although many Germans oppose the border, it was acknowledged that the borderlands have already shifted and to reverse it now could cause unrest. The other participants were eventually persuaded on the issue."
StalinNotes.22.d:0 "The world welcomed news that a final peace treaty was signed over the unification of Germany. The Western powers are satisfied over the guarantee of democratic rights for the new German states. The Soviets see the required neutrality of Germany as a major success. A neutral Germany offers a buffer state between the two alliances. Germans are said to be excited with the agreement, though there is some controversy regarding the final borders established by the agreement."
StalinNotes.23.d:0 "The newly elected coalition of conservative parties is attending the Peace Conference on the Unification of Germany being held with the current occupying powers. The Christian Democratic Party is the largest in the coalition and is expected to pursue a restoration of the 1937 border and secure democratic rights. The Soviet Union will want to minimize the German military and its neutrality in European as well as global issues."
StalinNotes.24.d:0 "The ongoing Peace Conference on German Unification agreed on the foreign policy and military for a united Germany. Although the Soviets wanted Germany to permanently be neutral and not have elections to guarantee a balanced government, they were persuaded to compromise. Germany will remain under military and neutrality restrictions for fifteen years. Even after the restrictions are lifted, Germany must agree to be cautious on its foreign policy. The vagueness of the language is being seen as an advantage for Germany once the restrictions are lifted."
StalinNotes.25.d:0 "In a major breakthrough, the participants of the Peace Conference on the Unification of Germany accepted an agreement for German borders. The Soviet Union sought to maintain the territorial division agreed at Potsdam, but could not overcome the pressure from the Allies and Germany on the issue. The Soviets agreed on returning Kalingrad and its surrounding areas to Germany. This is a major victory for the German government and will be popularly received by the German people. Poland and the Soviet Union will not be satisfied with this outcome, though the Soviets promised to handover administration of the returned territory back to the Germans. The United States supported this effort to push the neutral buffer into more Soviet space.."
StalinNotes.26.d:0 "The world welcomed news that the occupying powers and Germany signed a final agreement on the unification of Germany. The agreement will see a period of neutrality and demilitarization along with guaranteed democratic rights for all German citizens. The Western powers are very satisfied with the results and many Europeans see the agreement as reducing tension across the continent. The Soviets will be satisfied with the neutrality and establishment of Germany as a buffer state, however, its temporary status may cause problems once those are lifted."
StalinNotes.27.d:0 "The Soviet, American, British, and French occupation forces are currently overseeing the setup for national elections across West and East Germany. The resulting government will represent Germany in the upcoming Peace Conference on the Unification of Germany. The Soviets had initially sought to hold the conference without German participation but compromised with the West on the condition the elections are run by the occupying powers. The Western powers sought the United Nations to oversee the elections but accepted the Soviet request. Germans are said to be buzzing with excitement over the election."
StalinNotes.28.d:0 "The Soviet Union will oversee elections in its German occupation zone to determine which government will represent Germany at the planned Peace Conference on German Unification. The elections are months away and already political parties are campaigning. There is no way to predict the outcome. We could let the German people decide in an election, however, a proposal was submitted to ensure a successful outcome for the Socialist Union Party. Local intelligence and military forces can guarantee electoral success, West Germany still has a larger population. To counter-act this, we can transfer the over one million ethnic Germans living in the Kazakh SSR. They can potentially be settled near Kaliningrad."
StalinNotes.29.d:0 "There are reports and rumors of increased railroad activity in East Germany. Specifically, it appears there are thousands of new Germans arriving to the country. The Soviet authorities are placing these people in temporary camps, with rumors they may eventually be settled in surrounding areas and Kaliningrad. Due to intelligence reports, the origin of these Germans appears to be the Kazakh SSR. The Soviets are transferring the large ethnic German population back to Germany, no doubt to add thousands of votes for the upcoming election in favor of their communist clients. The Soviet secrecy and refusal to comment on this population indicates a wider scheme of potential electoral manipulation.\n The polls must be watched closely."
StalinNotes.30.d:0 "Elections on a national government to represent Germany in the upcoming Peace Conference on German Unification is to take place in the coming weeks. Reporters in East Germany notice that amid the political campaigning, their are large numbers of Germans arriving from the Soviet Union. It appears Soviet authorities are transferring ethnic Germans deported during the war back to the country in order to participate in the elections. Soviet authorities declined to comment on the issue and Western observers are expressing concern this represents a Soviet plot to manipulate the results in favor of the Socialist Unity Party."
StalinNotes.31.d:0 "The results from the recent national election across West and East Germany show a remarkable surge of support for the communist Socialist Union Party. The details are still coming in, but it appears the communists polled exceptionally in East Germany. The gains of leftists in West Germany indicates the final government will likely be a coalition of leftist parties led by the communist party. The Western powers and West German government are raising questions over the results and emergency meetings are being held across those capitals. The Soviet Union has praised the results and call on all parties to respect the electoral results. The Soviet decision to return deported ethnic Germans and ceding some territory back to East Germany are said to have played a critical role in the results."
StalinNotes.32.d:0 "Our intelligence reports on the ground, media reports, and the electoral data indicate there was likely widespread electoral fraud in the Soviet occupation zone. These results ensure a leftist German government would represent Germany in the future conference. This will give the Soviets a strong position for the negotiations. We can withdraw our support for the conference and the election, effectively ending the recent peace effort. Although the Soviets will complain, it will likely be well-received by our allies and many Germans. However, it may be in our interest to let the peace conference continue, even if the German representatives are pro-Soviet they will still have their own national interests on some of the issues. The decision of the Soviets to return German deportees and cede land to East Germany provided a boost of support for the socialists in West Germany."
StalinNotes.33.d:0 "The election results are showing a leftist victory in national polls. The communist party in particular performed very well. Reports, including from the media, indicate the Soviet occupying forces, overseeing the polls in East Germany, were engaged in manipulating the ballots to ensure a communist victory. The communists would have to rule with other leftist parties and lead Germany at the peace conference. This would mitigate how pro-Soviet they are. However, it is clear the elections are not genuine, and we can easily refuse to continue the process. The Americans, French, and British have all indicated their support if we choose to end the process. The decision of the Soviets to return German deportees and cede land to East Germany provided a boost of support for the socialists in West Germany."
StalinNotes.34.d:0 "The Western powers and West Germany have refused to move forward with peace negotiations following recent elections. The Soviet Union is accused of rigging the polls in East Germany to secure a communist surge. Without a legitimate result, the German people cannot be properly represented. The Soviet Union is loudly criticizing the West for sabotaging the peace effort because the elections did not go in its favor. West Germany asserts the elections prove the illegitimacy of the East German regime."
StalinNotes.35.d:0 "The world media eagerly reported on the recent elections being held across West and East Germany. Despite apprehension regarding the voting in East Germany, all indications are that Germans were able to vote freely. The major political parties in both West and East Germany were allowed to freely campaign. All the occupying powers, Germans, and Europeans will be watching the results carefully. The winning coalition will lead the German delegation in the upcoming peace conference to finalize the unification of Germany. The Christian Democratic Party and Socialist Union Party are expected to be the two largest winners in the election."
StalinNotes.36.d:0 "A coalition of conservative parties won the recent elections held across West and East Germany. The new government will lead Germany at the peace conference. The Soviets will not be satisfied with the results, but are expected to push for a compromise in its favor. The allied powers hope a friendly German government can help it push its objectives in the discussion. Germans will be eagerly watching the progress of the negotiations and hope for a united, peaceful Germany."
StalinNotes.37.d:0 "The Peace Conference on German Unification agreed on restoring some of the eastern border of Germany in exchange for a strict foreign policy. There will be no restrictions on the German military, but there is an expectation Germany will maintain a military to secure its borders and preserve internal peace. The Soviet Union sought to maintain the boundaries established by the Potsdam Agreement but were forced to compromise in order to preserve permanent German neutrality. Poland will likely be upset with the arrangement, but the Soviets promised to return administration of the territories back to the German government. The German government did not get all its territorial demands but were able to get Kalingrad and its surrounding area."
StalinNotes.38.d:0 "The ongoing Peace Conference on German Unification agreed to preserve democratic and individual rights for all Germans. The issue of free elections are to be voted on by the German people after the conference. The Western powers wanted free elections guaranteed but the Soviets wanted a permanent, power-sharing government to maintain political balance in the country. The referendum will leave the issue for the German people to decide."
StalinNotes.39.d:0 "The conservative German government and occupying powers signed a final agreement on the unification of Germany. The treaty requires strict neutrality for Germany and a guarantee of democratic rights. The issue of free elections will be resolved through a national referendum. More significantly, the signatories agreed to restore some of the pre-World War II German borders. The agreement is not completely satisfactory for any one side, however, the Allied powers were able to secure a democratic Germany. The Soviet Union managed to ensure the new German state remains neutral, providing them with a buffer zone and deny the United States access to the potential German industrial or military power."
StalinNotes.40.d:0 "Germans across the country took to the polls to decide if the country will have free elections. The recently agreed upon treaty ensures democratic and individual rights. However, the issue of free elections was not resolved. Supporters argue free elections are an important part of any democracy. However, opponents argue a future constitution should guarantee a balance of seat distributions for all political ideologies. This would prevent one ideology from dominating and help maintain neutrality. Experts on the issue say there are no clear indications which side will win."
StalinNotes.41.d:0 "The recent national elections resulted in a victory for a coalition of leftist parties. The Socialist Union Party is the largest party in the coalition. The result is being welcomed by the Soviet Union and its experts believe this will help it in upcoming peace negotiations over the unification of Germany with the occupying powers. Although the Western powers will be disappointed, there is an understanding that the coalition will be mindful of the national interests of an independent, united German state."
StalinNotes.42.d:0 "The Peace Conference for German Unification reached a compromise on the borders for Germany. In exchange for an acceptance of the borders from the Potsdam Agreement in exchange for temporary neutrality. The border agreement satisfies the Soviet Union and Poland. For the West, the agreement on temporary neutrality opens the possibility of a pro-Western German state in the future. Germany must be strictly neutral for fifteen years before the restrictions are lifted."
StalinNotes.44.d:0 "The occupying powers and Germany signed a final agreement on the issue of German unification. The treaty resolves a number of issues with regards to the final border, democratic rights, and neutrality of the German state. Neither the Allied occupiers or the Soviet Union are entirely satisfied with the results. However, the compromises reached are expected to preserve peace not just in Germany but in Europe as well. The international community is largely welcoming the results and praising the participating states for their ability to reach an agreement."
StalinNotes.45.d:0 "The German parliament is holding discussions on whether free elections should be a part of a future German constitution. Supporters for elections argue the democratic rights guaranteed by the recent treaty can only be legitimized through the act of holding elections. Opponents believe Germany must establish a balance of political power to preserve the neutrality and ensure no strongman or radical party ever gains power. The debates are expected to be spirited and intense."
StalinNotes.46.d:0 "The West, particularly the United States reacted to our genuine peace efforts with machinations and impossible counter-offers. They have revealed their warmongering objectives. The West wishes to rearm Germany as a military power to aid them in their ambition to overthrow the socialist regimes of Eastern Europe. Elements of the German press are reporting on our generous terms and the American involvement in its failure. The East German government expressed its satisfaction with our efforts for achieving lasting peace."
StalinNotes.47.d:0 "The exchange of notes between the Soviet Union and the German occupying powers fizzled out. The Americans argue the Soviets were never genuine and only made it appear they were interested in a just peace for Germany. Although many in our government agree with this assessment, there is a growing choir of officials and media suggesting the failed negotiations may be an opportunity lost. This has led to some discontent among Germans, but overall, we do not expect this to extend into public protests or expressions of anger."
StalinNotes.48.d:0 "The notes being exchanged by the Soviet Union and our allies ended in failure. The Soviets appeared to be offering generous terms on a unified Germany, however, our efforts to negotiate and push the discussions further were rebuffed. It is clear the Soviets were simply using these discussions as a propaganda tool and a way to legitimize their illegal regime in East Germany. Although our allies and people accept these facts, there are many Germans who believe it is our fault the talks failed. It will take some time to rebuild relations, however, they will eventually recognize the communist duplicity for what it was."
StalinNotes.49.d:0 "The strong effort by the Soviet Union to secure a just resolution to the question of German unification and peace ended inconclusively. The West reacted negatively and actively ensured this effort failed. They did so by making outrageous demands and spreading rumors that undermined the sincerity of the Soviets. West Germany showed their true colors as an American puppet by going along with their propaganda. In the end, all Germans saw how one side sought peace while the other chose to continue escalating tensions."
StalinNotes.57.d:0 "Our recent effort to seek a final peace over Germany ended when the West abandoned the effort when it appeared, they would not achieve a total victory in the peace negotiations. In pursuing peace, we returned a million German deportees from the Kazakh SSR. These returnees were sent to Kaliningrad and areas of Silesia which had previously been administered by Poland. The lands are being jointly administered between us and the Germans. However, since the end of the peace talks, there are increasing reports of ethnic clashes between Germans and Poles in Silesia. The Polish government has raised its concerns and are calling for the return of the territory. We must decide to either keep the territory with the Germans or return the Polish administrators."
StalinNotes.59.d:0 "The Soviet Union announced it was removing East German administrators in Silesia replacing them with Polish officials to jointly administer the territory. Earlier, the Soviets had pushed Poland to cede these lands to East Germany before elections to determine the future government of a unified German state. Many Germans now recognize the Soviets were simply playing politics and only pretended to care about German rights and claims. Our government will issue a condemnation for the continued ethnic cleansing of Germans by Soviet Union and their puppets."
StalinNotes.58.d:0 "The Soviets emphatically stated the Silesia lands they forced us to cede to East Germany will remain under German control. They note the influx of German returnees has transformed the local demographics and returning Polish rule would potentially cause a major refugee crisis and infighting among socialist brethren. This is a disappointing decision and we expressed this. However, the Soviets insisted there are no plans or considerations for the ceding of anymore land to the Germans. We made it clear that if such a scenario were to occur, our government could not guarantee the Polish people will not react in a dramatic fashion. We can only hope the Soviets offer no more surprises."
StalinNotes.43.d:0 "The Peace Conference for German Unification reached a compromise on the borders for Germany. In exchange for Germany agreeing to drop its claims for the entire 1937 border, Germany will agree to accept a period of temporary neutrality. The border agreement satisfies the Soviet Union and Poland, who feared the Soviets, or a new unified German government would press for more territory. For the West, the agreement on temporary neutrality opens the possibility of a pro-Western German state in the future. Germany must be strictly neutral for fifteen years before the restrictions are lifted. Prior to the conference, the Soviet Union ceded some lands around Kaliningrad to East Germany."
StalinNotes.51.d:0 "A recent initiative by the Soviet Union to resolve the final peace with Germany floundered. This dampened hope across Europe for a resolution that could cool tensions between the East and West. Soviet leader Joseph Stalin started the effort by exchanging notes, with what many perceived were generous concessions on issues related to a democratic government and economic freedoms within a neutral German state. It is unclear what caused the effort to fail, the Soviets accuse the West of sabotaging the effort with unreasonable demands. The United States claimed the Soviet offer was purely meant for propaganda and to undermine both the Allied states and West Germany. Regardless, many Germans are left wondering if a golden opportunity for unification has slipped by."
StalinNotes.50.d:0 "The recent agreement regarding the unification with Germany appears to have failed. The government in West Germany refused to accept the terms of the treaty and will not meet with East German officials, who they do not recognize. Following this announcement, the United States, along with Britain and France announced they will not force West Germany to comply with the terms of the agreement. This effectively ends the soviet peace effort. The Soviets expressed their outrage and accuse the West of militarizing Europe. Internationally, the Soviets are largely being praised for taking a stance on the issue while the United States faces criticism for negotiating an agreement, only to backtrack."
StalinNotes.54.d:0 "The large number of German immigrants being brought to East Germany were being settled around Kalingrad. However, returnees in East Germany are moving into areas of Silesia, which is under Polish rule. The Polish authorities have raised concerns. Our own officials fear those German immigrants may not be eligible to vote if they continue to spread in the area. To ensure these votes count and to undermine propaganda from the West that we seek to punish Germany, we will cede Kalingrad and push Poland to cede those areas of Silesia to East Germany. Polish officials and authorities in the area will be replaced by East Germans. Although the Polish government will not be happy with our action, we are confident they will not stir a fuss as long as no more territory is ceded back to Germany. This will give our supporters in Germany a major boost before the vote."
StalinNotes.52.d:0 "The Soviet Union confirmed reports about a massive influx of ethnic Germans being returned to East Germany. The Soviets added that they were ceding Kaliningrad and Poland would cede parts of Silesia to East Germany to host the returnees. This marks a major shift from the Soviets who had long demanded the Potsdam Agreement borders be implemented to its entirety. Although the United States condemns the action as political theatre meant to manipulate the polls, many Germans are celebrating the news. Our own government can only point out that all our territorial claims were not met, but even this concession is being widely praised. Many analysts now believe the polls are tilting to the socialist parties."
