ADR_Found_the_ministry_of_culture_desc:0 "Austria has been the Home of many Cultural Geniuses for Ages. From Musicians like Mozart to our Royal History and Painting Collections. But those are Masterpieces of old. We need new ones. Ones that express our newfound Socialist Culture. This is why the Ministry of Culture wil be Established. A Important side-task it will have is also making sure any Anti-Socialist Art gets promoted or shown in Public."
ADR_Embrace_Socialist_Realism:0 "Embrace Socialist Realism"

Despite its name, the figures in the style are very often highly idealized, especially in sculpture, where it often leans heavily on the conventions of classical sculpture. Socialist realism was made with an extremely literal and obvious meaning, usually showing an idealized USSR. Socialist realism was usually devoid of complex artistic meaning or interpretation."

ADR_Promote_the_legacy_of_the_failed_1918_coup_desc:0 "On 12 November 1918, the party attempted a coup d'état, which was not professionally organised and not authorised by the Soviet government. Within hours, the coup attempt was defeated. But even if the coup didn´t succeed, it was still a Important moment in history where we almost joined our Socialist Soviet Comrades. We´ll promote this Moment as the time, Socialism in Austria was at our Grasp"

ADR_Pardon_Soviet_Crimes_in_Austria_desc:0 "We admit that the Soviets might have commited a few Crimes as the reached our Lands during the Second World War. But at the same time we cannot blame them. After all the Nazis have commited many unspeakable crimes that we were fully involved in. Not to mention the PoWs that were brought to Austria during the War were killed and worked to death. Safe to say, even if harsh what the Soviets did, we should still Pardon and Forgive them for Liberating us in the End."

ADR_Intensify_Denazification_desc:0 "Even after the Horrors of the Second World War, the horrors that the Nazis commited in Austria, there are still many many Fascist Remnants. Worse they are each day convincing more and more people to give Fascism another try. We have to announce Denazification and start getting rid of these Parasites!"

ADR_Replace_the_Hitler_Youth_with_the_Pioneers_desc:0 "Many of our Youths are still former members of the Hitler Youth.

ADR_Open_Holocaust_Museums:0 "Open Holocaust Museums"
ADR_Open_Holocaust_Museums_desc:0 "There are a bunch of Work- and Death camps left over inside our nation that the Nazis left behind before escaping the Incoming Red Army.

ADR_Publish_textbooks_on_Nazi_war_crimes_desc:0 "Setting up Museums and Pioneer Organizations isn´t enough.

ADR_Place_the_remaining_blame_on_the_West_German_Government_desc:0 "It´s hard to believe that a cough cough GERMAN woud commit such Horrible crimes. Question is though. Which Germany are we supposed to put the blame on for Hitler. East Germany is a option, but then again they are our Socialist Comrades now. So we´ll just put the blame on the West Germans. It will surely hurt our Diplomatic relationship, but who cares. They´re Capitalists anyways!"
ADR_Found_the_Democratic_republic_of_Austria:0 "Found Austrian Democratic Republic"
ADR_Found_the_Democratic_republic_of_Austria_desc:0 "East Germany has adopted a new name for Itself. No longer are they called Soviet Military Administration in Germany, they have now Proclaimed to be the Deutsche Demokratische Republik, DDR for short. We should take notes of our neighbor and do the same, Proclaiming ourselves to be the Austrian Democratic Republic!"
ADR_KPO_Uber_Alles:0 "KPO Uber Alles"
ADR_KPO_Uber_Alles_desc:0 "The KPO is a true bastion of hope in Eastern Austria.

ADR_Inauguration_of_General_Secretary_Johann_Koplenig_desc:0 "General Secretary Koplenig has been elected as our First General Secretary, having the monumental task of turning a before Fascist Nation into a Socialist nation where anyone no matter their Ethnicity or Color is Comrade.

ADR_Denounce_the_division_of_Austria:0 "Denounce the Division of Austria"
ADR_Denounce_the_division_of_Austria_desc:0 "The fact that our Nation just like Germany has to be divided is a disgarce. The allies, Fearing that the Soviets might expand their Influence too far, will rather split us apart between East and West, just because we have been Liberated as a Socialist Goverment. Not to mention that the West Austrians haven´t protested this move at all. Wel unlike them, Koplenig has quite a few words to say about the Division of Austria!"

ADR_Fully_commit_to_the_international_workers_struggle_desc:0 "Just like the Soviet Union and the rest of Socialist Genossen, we are hoping to one day liberate all the Workers on Earth and once and for all get rid of Capitalism. It´s of course clear that such a goal is more than monumental and will likely take decades till it´s actually achieved. Meanwhile though we won´t just sit idly by. By commiting to the Workers Struggle, it will be clear to the rest of the Eastern Block and the World that we stand with the Workers and will do anything in our might to support their battle!"
ADR_European_Comrades:0 "European Comrades"
ADR_European_Comrades_desc:0 "Our European Comrades have been almost fully Liberated just like us by the Soviet Union after the Second World War and showed us how powerful Socialism can be if we only work together. Since our Goverment has only recently been Liberated, it´s only natural that we open Diplomatic talks with the rest of Socialist Europe to discuss trade Agreements and on how we are gonna Liberate the remaining Workers still being Opressed by the Capitalists in the West!"
ADR_Economic_cooperation_with_our_former_allies:0 "Improve Relations With Former Allies"
ADR_Economic_cooperation_with_our_former_allies_desc:0 "Most, if not all of our former Allies have become Socialist just like us.

Any friendship can be revived at a Feast of Beer and Bratwursts!"
ADR_Pay_off_Soviet_War_reparations:0 "Pay off Soviet War Reparations"
ADR_Pay_off_Soviet_War_reparations_desc:0 "The Soviets liberated us but just like anything in Life, it wasn´t for free. The Soviets gave us a hefty debt to repay as Reparations for the damage we and the Germans did during the  Second World War. Including Intrest rates of course. Luckily though, we have a lot save up  and even if our Industry is for now small yet growing, we´ll be able to pay the debt back right now, showing the Soviet Union how much we are dedicated to fixing relationships between our Nations and on how serious we are about the Socialist cause."
ADR_Asian_Comrades:0 "Asian Comrades"
ADR_Asian_Comrades_desc:0 "Unsuprisingly, Europe wasn´t the only part of the World to have a explosion in Socialist Nations and Movements. From the PRC that kicked out the old Nationalist Goverment and pushed it out of the Mainland, to the Korean Peninsula that is, just like us, split in half. Which doesn´t seem to stop them from holding onto their Socialist Beliefs still."
ADR_Recognize_North_Vietnam:0 "Recognize North Vietnam"
ADR_Recognize_North_Vietnam_desc:0 "North Vietnam is just like North Korea, a Socialist nation that is in a fight with it´s Nationalist counterpart.

We´ll do that right away!"
ADR_Establish_relations_with_Kim_and_Mao:0 "Establish Relations With Kim and Mao"
ADR_Establish_relations_with_Kim_and_Mao_desc:0 "Let´s not walk around hot Borscht. China and North Korea have been the Elephant in the room for a long time. From the Chinese Civil War to the korean Unification War. Them being the Biggest Socialist Powers in Asia, not including Vietnam which will be tackled on it´s own later, we´ll contact both Goverments and attempt to Establish Relations in the name of Socialism!"
ADR_From_an_economic_partnership_with_our_old_subjects:0 "Establish Volkswirtschaftspakt"
ADR_From_an_economic_partnership_with_our_old_subjects_desc:0 "The Goal of the so called Volkswirtschaftspakt will be to emulate the raw Industrial Power and scale just like the Austria-Hungary of old.

ADR_Begin_reconstruction:0 "Begin Reconstruction"
ADR_Begin_reconstruction_desc:0 "It´s no surprise to say that our Industry isn´t in the best shape it could be after the War. Not to fear though.

ADR_Beg_the_Soviets_to_return_stolen_industry_desc:0 "The Soviets occupied some of our Industry as they were pushing deeper and deeper into our nation during the war, confiscating Industry and using it to Produce goods for their Troops in field.

ADR_Request_East_German_Industrial_Aid:0 "Request East German Industrial Aid"
ADR_Request_East_German_Industrial_Aid_desc:0 "While we are Reconstructing our Industry, the idea has been proposed that we ask our fellow Socialist East German brothers for Industrial Aid. The East Germans will be more than eager to help us out we are sure of that. The sight of fellow Socialist Germans might even show our populace how great Socialism is in bringing us together!"
ADR_Fully_commit_to_collectivization:0 "Begin Collectivization"
ADR_Fully_commit_to_collectivization_desc:0 "Even if some might find Collectivization to be cruel, claiming that we are seizing land that was earned by workers and not by greedy Landlords, it´s still a good policy to enact. After all, if the land is in the hands of the State, it will be better protected and reach it´s full it´s potential with our financial aid."
ADR_Import_grain_to_stop_food_riots:0 "Import Grain to Stop Food Riots"
ADR_Import_grain_to_stop_food_riots_desc:0 "Our Agricultural Industry had been struggling. Most of our farmlands are still mostly craters from Allied Bombings. And it´s taking the crops a while to grow before they can be properly harvested. Understandably the workers are not happy with not having any food on the plate and have understandably began to strike. They do not need to worry anymore though, as we have signed trade deals to have food Imported from our Socialist neighbors and ration this food, until the food situation at home is fixed."
ADR_Modernize_machine_tooling:0 "Modernize Machine Tooling"
ADR_Modernize_machine_tooling_desc:0 "Now that the Industry is getting back into shape, we have encountered another problem.

ADR_Housing_expansion_in_Vienna:0 "Housing Expansion in Vienna"
ADR_Housing_expansion_in_Vienna_desc:0 "Vienna is a giant city. Or at least it was until it was just like Berlin split into two, giving us the less developed side while giving the West the best parts. East Wien, being more rural than the West, thus it will have it´s housing Expanded to give all our workers a roof over their head!"
ADR_Jumpstart_heavy_industry_in_Burgen-land:0 "Jumpstart Heavy Industry in Burgenland"
ADR_Jumpstart_heavy_industry_in_Burgen-land_desc:0 "The Heavy Industry has boomed during the war, but eventually it became the target of allied bombings. As of now we currently have no Heavy Industry in service. With the West threathening our Borders every day, it´s only logical we restore weapon production to defend our borders."
ADR_Launch_show_trials:0 "Launch Show Trials"
ADR_Launch_show_trials_desc:0 "Even if the nation has been rid largely if not entirely of Fascist Influence, there remain still a few enemies in our Nation and Goverment.

Not many of them are left since many have either moved on or died from old Age. But there remain a small number of those who are still in the nation. With the Nation being Socialist just like the Soviet Union, it is only logical for us to return these White Army Soldiers to the Motherland."

ADR_Delegitimize_the_Reunification_Faction_desc:0 "In the Nation, there is a Faction that is attempting to convince our populace to support the Reunification with the West. Generally there is nothing wrong with that, as we´d love to Reunify with the West as well!...But only if that meant that the nation would remain Socialist, a thing that this Faction ignores, wanting Unification at any cost. It remains rather small at the moment, but it cannot be risked that they may grow. Efforts will be made to Delegitimize this faction, and convince the Workers not to join them."
