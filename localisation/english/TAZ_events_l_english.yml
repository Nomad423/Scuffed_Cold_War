 taz.1.d:0 "The majority people of Zanzibar are black Africans. Despite this, the Arab minority rules the political landscape as a remnant of British meddeling in the 19th century. But this has changed today. After the genrrymandered elections of 1963, the black Africans, led by John Okello rose up against the sultan and the Arab minority. In just three hours, 300-600 African soldiers took over the police stations and governmental buildings, forcing the sultan to flee the country. Some people have however taken the opportunity to take revenge on the Arabs, murdering between 5000 and 12000."
