 northseaflood.1.d:0 "A major storm struck the British Isles and the Low Countries on January 31, 1953, causing a flood and serious damage. Resulting in 2,551 deaths, mostly in the Netherlands and Belgium, the storm caused floods of 18.4 feet above sea level, placing 527 square miles of Dutch farmland underwater. Many dykes or sea walls were breached, causing 70,000 to evacuate. The US Army sent helicopters to assist with the rescue, and the Red Cross has been overwhelmed with donations. There has been further talk of a project known as the Delta Works to protect major river estuaries and prevent a tragedy on this scale from ever happening again."
 northseaflood.2.d:0 "A storm surge has lead to the greatest flood in our lifetimes as our main sea defenses all broke causing mass flooding in Zeeland and South Holland. Despite warnings from the Rijkswaterstaat local whether reports gave no alerts to residences in the country resulting in an unexpected impeding wave of flooding which killed 1,836 people and left tens of thousands displaced and homeless. With 9% of our country's farmland flooded, tens of thousands of livestock killed, and tens of thousands of buildings destroyed this will come as a kick in the teeth during our reconstruction following the Second World War."
 northseaflood.3.d:0 "Massive flooding has taken place on our eastern seaboard as surges from Kent to eastern Scotland kill hundreds of people. While not as nearly as affected as our neighbor across the channel, the damage can not be understated. This is the worst flood in this chapter of history with tens of thousands of people displaced, we will need a concerted effort to recover the damages. Already talks in parliament are being made on preventing such a disaster again."
 northseaflood.4.d:0 "Flemings are just responding to the immediate shock of this unexpected natural disaster. Our sea walls near antwerp were entirely breached and destroyed causing damage all along the coast of north eastern flanders. However thankfully very few have died in our country compared to the Netherlands and the United Kingdom and our damages also hardly compare, so our recovery will be nowhere near as difficult."
