 Operation_Searchlight.1.d:0 "The GHQ in Rawalpindi is currently considering how to plan a security solution to the current political impasse. One of the biggest issues to consider is what to do with the Bengali soldiers, especially members of the East Bengal Rifles. If we must launch a security operation to save the country, the Bengali soldiers may not be trustworthy to carry out their tasks. Mostly there is concern of infiltrators. Eastern Command believes they can develop a plan to disarm and detain those soldiers until the crisis is resolved. However, there are some in GHQ who argue the Bengali soldiers are highly trained and ideologically devoted to Pakistan. They argue we should instead use these forces as part of the security operation to secure the border and not promote the idea of an anti-Bengali operation."
 Operation_Searchlight.2.d:0 "The GHQ in Rawalpindi is currently considering how to plan a security solution to the current political impasse. One of the biggest issues is how to dismantle the Awami League and their supporters. Working closely with the Eastern Command and intelligence agencies, a list of their top members is being compiled. Their movements and locations are also being tracked so if an operation is launched, our forces will move in to arrest them all at once. Ideally such an operation will decapitate the leadership of the anti-state miscreants."
 Operation_Searchlight.3.d:0 "It became clear that Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and Zulfikar Bhutto were incapable of reconciling. From his final conversations with both men, President Yahya concluded the situation was unsalvageable. It is clear that Rahman will assemble the National Assembly without the boycotting West Pakistani members and pass the Six Points or launch an insurgency. In a recent speech he called on Bengalis to launch a civil disobedience campaign for freedom and turn every home into a fortress. It is clear action must be taken. Before President Yahya left Dacca, he privately he informed Eastern Command to commence Operation Searchlight to stop this march towards anarchy and civil war. As the President left the city, Pakistani troops across East Pakistan began a simultaneous operation to end the Awami League threat to the integrity of Pakistan."
 Operation_Searchlight.4.d:0 "Dacca University has long been a cesspool of youth resistance and anti-state ideology. In recent days the students were observed by the press for engaging in military drills on campus. The faculty has largely supported such militancy and securing the campus and searching it for weapons was one of the main objectives of during the first night of Operation Searchlight. As other units secured Dacca, the 22nd Baluch and 32nd Punjab were tasked with seizing the campus. The operation was a success, senior faculty were quickly detained but our attempt to capture student leaders in the dorms led to armed resistance by students. Our forces gave a befitting reply, easily overwhelming the resistance and securing the campus. The initial reports are that at least a hundred miscreants were neutralized and arms were captured. The campus is secure."
 Operation_Searchlight.5.d:0 "During Operation Searchlight our forces successfully secured Dacca University, detaining dangerous militants, neutralized armed miscreants, and capturing militant training equipment. However, we are facing extensive backlash from locals and the international press. The media is reporting our forces used indiscriminate fire, killing or executing at least a hundred students and faculty. In particular the images of our use of tanks to break into some dorms are being especially condemned. Regardless of this backlash, our forces acted under orders to use whatever means was necessary to swiftly crush the insurgency developing on the campus."
 Operation_Searchlight.6.d:0 "When Operation Searchlight commenced, we deployed battalions across Dacca to secure city. Across East Pakistan other units went into action, one of the priorities being to capture senior Awami League leaders to decapitate potential resistance. This operation was generally successful. Although we did capture a number of the more senior officials in the initial hours, it appears the lower level officials were able to catch wind of the operation and fled. We believe a number may already be on their way to India or hiding in rural areas, no doubt coordinating a militant response against the state. Regardless, our officers are confident that the Awami League has been extensively dismantled by the arrests."
 Operation_Searchlight.7.d:0 "Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, the leader of the Awami League and mastermind of the plot to destroy Pakistan was arrested at his home by a platoon of special forces soldiers. Our forces moved swiftly, faced no resistance and took Rahman without incident. He is already being boarded on a plane bound for West Pakistan where he will stand trial for his anti-state conspiracy. Initial reports indicate Rahman is shocked by the turn of events and is asking to speak with President Yahya Khan to resolve the crisis. He is claiming to support the military action in order to protect Pakistan from civil war but insists he is not part of any conspiracy. This is clearly a ploy meant to gain sympathy and perhaps orchestrate his escape, regardless, he will be sorted out once he reaches his prison in Lyalpur."
 Operation_Searchlight.8.d:0 "As part of Operation Searchlight, the West Pakistani officers and soldiers in the East Bengal Rifles battalions moved to disarm their fellow Bengali officers and soldiers. This part of the operation proved unsuccessful. In some cases, our men succeeded in the disarming, with the Bengalis returned to their barracks. In some instances, the Bengali soldiers refused to disarm and resisted, leading to their destruction by our forces. However, in some instances, especially in the case of the 2nd East Bengal Rifles, those Bengalis acted first and massacred our men before the disarming could take place. We had to dispatch a brigade to restore order, discovering the grizzly scenes of how they slaughtered our men. When news of the escalating violence reached the barracks, many of the Bengalis who had peacefully surrendered panicked and fled into the jungle. The East Bengal Rifles are neutralized, but many of the highly trained soldiers and officers escaped to the jungle."
 Operation_Searchlight.9.d:0 "During Operation Search Light the Eastern Command deployed its forces across the province to secure its objectives. The six battalions of the East Bengal Rifles however, were unique units in that they were largely Bengali soldiers. To reduce the risk of them revolting, they were deployed largely to secure strategic facilities outside major cities or key border areas. This reduced the risk of putting the soldiers in a position to fire on fellow Bengalis. So far the East Bengal Rifles have performed their tasks admirably, however, as news spread of the violence that occurred during Operation Searchlight, a small number of soldiers and officers fled their units. These men will no doubt seek to join anti-state miscreants, but overall, the East Bengal Rifles are doing their duty as loyal servants of Pakistan."
 Operation_Searchlight.10.d:0 "During the initial hours of Operation Searchlight, the Pakistan military sought to neutralize potential hotbeds of Bengali resistance and arrest potential leaders of such an insurrection. In the initial phase our forces faced poorly armed and trained students along with some armed resistance from Awami League cadres. They proved no match to our forces but they fled either to India or deeper in the jungle. Unfortunately, a number of mid-level and some senior Awami League leaders and their allies managed to escape to India. In addition, a number of Bengali soldiers and officers within the military have deserted their posts and joined the growing resistance movement. These people plus local Bengalis seduced by enemy propaganda are forming guerilla bands. They already are enjoying support among Bengalis who call these fighters Mukti Bahini, meaning freedom fighters."
 Operation_Searchlight.11.d:0 "The failure to effectively disarm the East Bengal Rifles battalions or the paramilitary East Pakistan Rifles battalions led to pitched battles and massacres on both sides. However, many of the Bengali rebel soldiers and officers managed to slip out and have found their way to India or they have joined up with Mukti Bahini bands forming deep in the jungle. The traitor officers are working with the Awami League leaders in India to better coordinate the Mukti Bahini and setup training camps. Much to our headache, our enemy will gain our training  and former soldiers, which will improve their operational effectiveness."
 Operation_Searchlight.12.d:0 "During Operation Searchlight much effort was made to place Bengali officers and units in positions and areas where they would not have to directly be involved in the combat operations. This was done to prevent the anti-state Awami League and their misguided supporters from trying to provoke rebellion within the ranks. These units performed admirably and in general carried out their orders. However, in the days following, they heard the reports of alleged massacres and violence that occurred, much of it enemy propaganda, but regardless it did have an effect. A number of Bengali officers have deserted to join Mukti Bahini bands or the Awami League in India. Some of the soldiers have defected also, but it is a trickle. At this point we can expect more desertions, but we have redeployed our forces to the point that there are no Bengali majority units in place anywhere in East Pakistan, so a revolt is unlikely."
 Operation_Searchlight.13.d:0 "As our forces in East Pakistan face increasing armed resistance and civil disobedience, the government authorized the Eastern Command to expand Martial Law Courts. This will allow authorities on the ground to quickly bring suspected militants or anti-state miscreants to the courts where a swift verdict can take place. The civil courts are too slow and lack experience when dealing with these types of cases. More importantly, this will allow us to conduct faster trials of the many Bengalis currently sitting in detention camps. Unfortunately, these camps are overflowing, making conditions miserable, allowing militants opportunities to manipulate their way out, and alienating the families of those detained. The new Martial Law regulations will strengthen our capacity to uproot the miscreants."
 Operation_Searchlight.14.d:0 "Eastern Command has always complained of a shortage in military units, but this cannot be helped as access to East Pakistan is difficult and there are security needs in West Pakistan. This leaves our forces stretched dangerously thin as it must contend with the Mukti Bahini, law and order, as well as the long border with India. Compounding these issues is the Bengali elements within the military and police who have either defected or are unreliable. There is a desperate need to establish more auxiliary forces to aid the military in its campaign against the Mukti Bahini. Thankfully, the leading religious parties in East Pakistan are loyal and they have called on their supporters to join our cause. With this influx of manpower, we have created Mujahid Forces, these are pro-Pakistani Bengalis and Biharis willing to carryout auxiliary functions that will free our forces to carry out military operations."
 Operation_Searchlight.15.d:0 "Operation Searchlight saw the situation in East Pakistan collapse into a virtual civil war with the Pakistan military engaged in a campaign against the Mukti Bahini, who are campaigning for an independent Bangladesh. Within the East Pakistani population, there are further divisions, although the Mukti Bahini enjoys support among a wide section of Bengalis, the religious Muslim parties and their supporters are supporting the Pakistan government. In addition, the large number of Biharis, refugees who came from India during Partition, are also largely loyal to Pakistan. This has led to reports of brutal massacres conducted by those communities loyal to Pakistan and the Pakistan Army itself. The Pakistan government dismisses such claims, but there is compelling evidence of Bengali Hindus being targeted by Muslim neighbors with the government refusing to intervene. These alleged massacres of Bengalis, backed by interviews and some photos are damning to the Pakistan government who at the very least appear complicit by not stopping these events from occurring."
 Operation_Searchlight.16.d:0 "Biharis is the collective term used for Muslim refugees from India who moved to East Pakistan during Partition. These families largely abandoned their ancestral homes and communities to start a new life in Pakistan. For them, they reject an independent Bangladesh and have remained largely loyal to the Pakistan state and its campaign against the Mukti Bahini. Since Operation Searchlight started, East Pakistan has descended into chaos as the Pakistan military campaign against the Mukti Bahini is being overshadowed by reports of ethnic massacres occurring across the territory. Although the international press largely has covered the alleged massacres of Bengalis, they have so far shied away from alleged massacres being conducted against the Biharis by either the Mukti Bahini or their Bengali neighbors. The Pakistan Army recently publicized several alleged sites of massacres and reporters interviewed survivors, currently protected within Pakistan Army cantonments. What is clear to many is that the fighting in East Pakistan is occurring on many levels, leading to mass suffering."
 Operation_Searchlight.17.d:0 "The Eastern Command in Dacca continues to struggle with the myriad of challenges its forces face in terms of fighting an insurgency, securing the Indian border, and administrating the province, among many others. The local government and bureaucracy are almost non-functioning as many have fled to join the rebels or refuse to serve in fear of retribution. However, Pakistan can count on the Biharis and many of the more religious Bengalis who remain committed to the ideology of Pakistan. In addition, new auxiliary forces are being raised to improve basic law and order and provide security for government officials. After a conference with civil servants, it was decided that loyalist Pakistanis will be appointed to key positions and given extensive powers, including control of local raised loyalist militias to ensure a continuation of governance in East Pakistan. Some fear such a move could fuel corruption or violent retributions, however, we have no choice and must restore governance by any means."
 Operation_Searchlight.18.d:0 "The international media has recently highlighted that of the millions of Bengalis fleeing East Pakistan to India, a large number of them are from the Hindu minority. These refugees bring tales of brutality and violence, mostly at the hands of neighbors and in some instances, Pakistan Army units. The Indian government calls the growing refugee situation a global crisis and condemns the Pakistan government for a campaign of extreme brutality on its own people. A spokesman for the Awami League told reporters the refugees and their stories are proof of a systematic campaign of genocide being done on the Bengali people. The Pakistan government strongly denies these accusations, it insists its forces are not targeting civilians, noting that the media is ignoring the acts of violence and massacres being conducted against pro-Pakistani civilians by the Mukti Bahini. Internationally, many leading artists, musicians, and politicians are calling for Pakistan to halt what they term to be a campaign of senseless violence."
 Operation_Searchlight.19.d:0 "The number of refugees flooding into Bengal is in the millions, with some predicting the number may eventually top ten million. These refugees are fleeing the current violence engulfing East Pakistan where the Mukti Bahini continue to fight for independence from the Pakistan government. On top of this conflict, there is also violent clashes occurring between the pro-independence Bengalis and the pro-Pakistani Bengalis and Biharis. Our government continues to publicize the Pakistani atrocities and pledged support for the refugees. However, the numbers are putting a severe strain on our resources and there are reports of clashes between frustrated refugees and locals. Some officials suggest Pakistan is facilitating the movement of refugees, especially of Hindu refugees to help it remove the province of what it sees as disloyal elements. We must monitor the situation closely to develop some response to end the refugee flow and violence."
 Operation_Searchlight.20.d:0 "The situation in East Pakistan is growing intolerable, in particular, it is clear that India plans to exploit the crisis to their advantage. The more time that passes, the more time India has to destroy us at their leisure. We have always argued the defence of the east lies in the west, perhaps now is the time to put that doctrine into practice. The Pakistan Air Force proposed they have a plan to launch a surprise assault on airbases all along the border with India and cripple their airpower before the first show is fired. Once the Indian Air Force is neutralized, our own forces should be able to carry the day with air superiority. Although President Yahya Khan and his close allies appear to like the plan, some of the officers expressed doubts such an operation could achieve its ambitions. A decision must be made."
 Operation_Searchlight.21.d:0 "The government and people of India were stunned to hear reports of Pakistani bombers targeting almost a dozen airfields on the western border. Fortunately, many of the fighters were in their re-enforced hangers, minimizing the damage by the Pakistani jets. The Pakistan government released a statement calling for its people to unite against Indian aggression. For our government, this strike marks the beginning of war, and gives us international legitimacy to firmly deal with the Pakistani military, especially in East Pakistan."
 Operation_Searchlight.22.d:0 "The Pakistan Air Force conducted its lighting attack against the Indian airfields, with hopes of knocking out their planes in the upcoming war. However, the initial reports are not good. Though our planes completed their objectives and performed admirably, their bombs had little effect on the airfields or Indian aircraft. Already runways damaged by bombs are being rapidly repaired. It appears the Indian aircraft were protected, and we did not commit an overwhelming number of aircraft which may have had more of an effect. Regardless, our planes are ready for operations and we must prepare for war!"
 Operation_Searchlight.23.d:0 "In shocking news from South Asia, fighter planes from Pakistan conducted strikes on major Indian airfields, some striking as deep as 400 kilometers into India. Although the Pakistan government claims it suffered no losses and inflicted heavy damage, the Indian government denies the report. The strikes, along the western border surprised analysts who thought it would be India acting along the East Pakistan border, not a Pakistani attack. Tensions escalated as the Pakistani military operations against Mukti Bahini rebels fighting for Bengali independence in East Pakistan intensified, causing millions of refugees to flee to India. The Indian government claims Pakistan is engaged in a campaign of senseless brutality against Bengalis simply demanding freedom. The Pakistanis however claim India is fueling the conflict and engaged in a military buildup of its own, provoking Pakistan to act. Regardless, it appears a full-scale military conflict has begun."

 BAN_Liberation_War.1.d:0 "The situation in East Pakistan is intolerable, the Indian military, with the backing of the government and people are prepared to do what is necessary to stop the Pakistan government. The international media and support is with our government as many condemn the brutal violence occurring in East Pakistan. However, the cabinet must decide on the objectives for our forces and government. Many argue the war objective should be purely the liberation of Bangladesh and the empowerment of the Bengalis in East Pakistan. Others argue we should also add objectives along our western borders and use the opportunity to resolve Kashmir as well. If we go with this objective, we will risk losing the international high ground and risk involvement from either China or the United States."
 BAN_Liberation_War.2.d:0 "A recent meeting of senior and military leaders recently agreed to consider expanding the objectives of the current conflict to include the liberation of Kashmir from Pakistani occupation. The Prime Minister recently concluded talks with senior diplomatic and military officials over expanding the conflict to include Kashmir objectives. The diplomats were adamant that keeping the objective focused on the liberation of East Pakistan and securing Bengali rights would ensure international support and maintain a moral high ground. While Kashmir may appear ripe for our intervention, making it a part of the current conflict will erode international support and may offer Pakistan new lifelines of support. The military leaders stated they would support whatever directives the government offered, adding that although the East Pakistan campaign is the main priority, the Indian armed forces are more than capable of adding Kashmir as a target."
 BAN_Liberation_War.3.d:0 "Our diplomatic sources and analysis of recent statements by the Indian government indicate they may seek to turn the recent conflict in East Pakistan as a springboard to seizing territories in Kashmir and upend the current status quo. If India were to solidify and gravely weaken Pakistan by seizing Kashmir as well as securing the independence of East Pakistan, it could lead to a strategic imbalance in South Asia. India would have no challenger to check its hegemony and our own position in the region would be gravely weakened. With these considerations, we are sending a private message to the Indian government demanding their assurance that India will not seek a unilateral resolution through armed force of the Kashmir dispute as it carries out war against Pakistan."
 BAN_Liberation_War.4.d:0 "Senior analysts from the CIA and State Department have provided reports that indicate the Indian government may use the current war with Pakistan as a means to capture Kashmir. Such an action does not appear justified considering the conflict is over the Bengali uprising in East Pakistan. More importantly, it would end the status quo in Kashmir and lead to long-term problems for the region. With this in mind, there is pressure for the President to inform the Indian Prime Minister of our concerns and ask for a concrete statement that seizing swaths of territory in Pakistan controlled Kashmir is not part of the plan. Other advisors note the Pakistani failures in resolving East Pakistan and their current unpopularity with the international community and urge us leave the situation and see how it plays out."
 BAN_Liberation_War.5.d:0 "The Chinese government has already made several hostile statements condemning our actions in East Pakistan. However, we recently received a private message in which the Chinese lay out in no uncertain terms that if we try to push Pakistan out of Kashmir, China would view it as an attack on their own territory. This powerful statement may perhaps be a bluff, but the senior military command states that waging war on both wings of Pakistan and dealing with a Chinese incursion, may stretch the military dangerously thin. With these considerations, we returned a note to China, insisting we have no intentions to change the territorial positions in Kashmir. The Prime Minister also directed the military to halt plans on finally liberating Kashmir and focus all attention on the liberation of Bangladesh."
 BAN_Liberation_War.6.d:0 "The Prime Minister received a phone call from the President of the United States. The President asked to be appraised of our intentions. The Prime Minister told the President India had quietly waited for months for Pakistan to halt its brutal campaign in East Pakistan or for the international community to step in. However, the growing refugee crisis, economic depletion, and fears of genocide forced India to act. The President stated he appreciated the perspective of the Indian government and stated the United States can appreciate how the situation deteriorated with regards to East Pakistan and the involvement of India. However, he noted his concerns over military movements in Kashmir and stated the United States would view any military attempt to expand territory in Kashmir by India as a blatant act of aggression and force his government to consider its options. The Prime Minister simply stated an appreciation of the American perspective and ended the call. The navy later informed the Prime Minister of US naval maneuvers near the Indian Ocean. Not wanting to lose international support or help Pakistan attract a superpower intervention, the Prime Minister directed the military to halt any planning or operations meant to drive Pakistan from Kashmir."
 BAN_Liberation_War.7.d:0 "The Indian government approached the United Nations for the implementation of a ceasefire to end the current fighting. Clearly they feel nothing else can be achieved or gained militarily for them and are ready to end the war. Our own forces have fought tenaciously and bravely for the nation and Islam. It is now up to the senior leadership to respond. Our diplomats say if we wish to try and improve our position on the ground, they could delay a ceasefire for up to ten days. However, if we have nothing else we can achieve or rectify within that timeframe, we can agree and begin the process of an immediate end to the fighting."
 BAN_Liberation_War.8.d:0 "Following our victory in Bangladesh we have taken into custody tens of thousands of Pakistani military, government, intelligence, and police officials. The Home Affairs Minister and Defence Minister have plans to house these POWs in camps across India. Spreading the prisoners out would prevent mass escapes or clandestine rescue operations. Holding on to these prisoners ensures us a strong bargaining chip in future negotiations with Pakistan. Bangladesh requested we hand them five hundred Pakistani officials and officers for war crimes. However, our high command is adamant we do not do that so that is not an option. Some advisors suggest we return most of the POWs, this would greatly improve relations with Pakistan and help us establish a new era for our ties and still keep our bargaining chip."
 BAN_Liberation_War.9.d:0 "Following our liberation of Bangladesh, there are reports of roving bands of Mukti Bahini and other groups of Bengalis exacting revenge on alleged Pakistani collaborators. Our own forces have ensured captured Pakistani officials and military personnel are protected, but there is a lot of negative media attention over the reprisals. The interim Bangladeshi government insists they will maintain law and order, however, our military leaders in Dacca believe this is not a reasonable expectation. They request we authorize the Indian military to step in and maintain law and order until the Bangladeshi government is ready to take the reins. We have to decide to accept this request, alienating the Bengalis, or leave the situation as is."
 BAN_Liberation_War.10.d:0 "In a public ceremony, the Indian military and government formally handed sovereignty to the new Republic of Bangladesh. Bengalis across Bangladesh welcomed their freedom with massive shows of celebration across the country. The Bangladeshi flag is waving on almost every home. Some in the delegation were irked by the lack of appreciation given to the Indian government, but overall the ceremony was a huge success. The new Bangladeshi government promised prosperity to their people, a proper rebuilding of the country, and demanded India hand over alleged Pakistani war criminals. Despite these early tensions, we are hopeful for an era of peace and prosperity with our new neighbor."
 BAN_Liberation_War.11.d:0 "The leaders of Pakistan arrived to the hill station of Simla to hold talks with the Indian government following the conclusion of the latest Indo-Pakistan War. The Pakistanis are said to be in a very weak negotiating position as they have already lost East Pakistan and India is in a clearly dominant position. For Pakistan, their objective appears to be the return of their POWs and preservation of the status quo in Kashmir. The only Pakistani bargaining chip is Sheikh Mujibur Rahman who remains in their custody. However, there is growing international pressure for them to release him to Bangladesh, eroding that advantage rapidly. For India, they are said to be interested in using the POWs and their military victory to force a change in regard to Kashmir and ensure Pakistan recognize Bangladesh."
 BAN_Liberation_War.12.d:0 "Pakistan in the initial talks called for the return of their POWs. The Pakistanis cite the Geneva Convention which calls for the immediate repatriation of POWs following the conclusion of combat. We informed the Pakistanis that some of these POWs are accused of war crimes by Bangladesh and the continued refusal to recognize Bangladesh implies the conflict is not resolved. This appears to be an opportunity for us to press Pakistan to release Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and recognize Bangladesh in exchange for the repatriation of POWs."
 BAN_Liberation_War.13.d:0 "The Indians have firmly informed us that the repatriation of POWs can only be done if our government releases Sheikh Mujibur Rahman and recognize Bangladesh. Considering the pressure we face over keeping Mujibur in custody, we have no choice but to accept this. However, we will inform the Indians we agree in principle with this request. With our positive reply, we will also call for India to restore the pre-war borders along our borders in the west. This includes maintaining the status of Kashmir as it was before the conflict began."
 BAN_Liberation_War.14.d:0 "The Pakistanis positively reacted to our proposal and we can expect the release of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman soon. We will begin the process of repatriating POWs but will do so slowly and only as Pakistan normalizes its ties with Bangladesh. The Pakistanis have also called for the restoration of pre-war borders and maintain the Kashmir as it was the hour before fighting began. Initial efforts to force them to accept the Kashmir border as permanent and resolved have stonewalled. The Pakistanis insist if they agreed to such a move there would be a risk of either a revolution or radical coup. Our own analysts concur, so instead we will insist Pakistan agree to peacefully resolve Kashmir as a bilateral issue between us. This will end their continued insistence on involving the United Nations and essentially resolve the conflict in our favor."
 BAN_Liberation_War.15.d:0 "The Indian government informed us they would only accept a return to the status quo on the western border if we agree to accept Kashmir as a bilateral issue. We have spent a lot of time working with the Indians on writing the language of this aspect in the final agreement. The Indians have accepted a version which to us is vague enough to allow us flexibility with Kashmir and the United Nations. However, from here on out, India will insist the conflict is a bilateral problem. Some of our senior legal advisors also note that if it comes to it, we can argue to the international community that this upcoming treaty was made under duress and is not binding. Considering our current situation, this is the best approach possible. In the future however, Pakistan will restore its glory and end this injustice."
 BAN_Liberation_War.16.d:0 "The Pakistan and Indian government agreed to sign an agreement to end their recent armed conflict. The two sides agreed in principle on the return of POWs and the restoration of pre-war borders in the West. Although the wording with regards to Bangladesh were vague, it is believed Pakistan accepted it would have to recognize the country and release Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. The biggest change is a statement calling the Kashmir dispute a bilateral issue between the two states. Following the treaty signing, the Indian government claimed this means the United Nation resolutions are no longer on the table with regards to Kashmir. The Pakistanis in contrast stated the wording simply states the two sides will work to peacefully together to resolve the conflict but it does not explicitly exclude the role of the international community. The Pakistani people have felt immense humiliation following the treaty, but the press is reporting the results were not as devastating as many feared it would be. The Indian government is already facing criticism from the opposition that it had squandered the military victory in the peace negotiations. Time will tell what the final results will be."

 BAN_Liberation_War.18.d:0 "Millions in Dacca greeted the arrival of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, the father of Bangladesh. After being held illegally by Pakistan for months, he has finally returned to the motherland. The Pakistani authorities released him and arranged for his journey to London where he boarded his flight home. Sheikh Mujibur Rahman was full of emotion as he expressed his love and pride for the people of Bangladesh who liberated themselves and survived a brutal military occupation. He echoed the words of the government when he pledged Bangladesh would not only recover but would ensure all victims of Pakistani atrocities received recognition and support from the state. He also promised socialism for the people and a new era of prosperity."
 BAN_Liberation_War.19.d:0 "After a long, agonizing wait for many military families, the last POWs crossed the Wagah border in Lahore and returned to Pakistan. Thousands of citizens greeted the soldiers as they crossed, many reuniting with their families after years apart. The Pakistan government long complained India had used the POWs as a bargaining chip and illegally held them in violation to the Geneva Convention. The returning POWs will be placed in temporary camps where the military will debrief them and decide who will rejoin the military and who will be discharged. Early reports from the POWs indicate that although they were treated relatively well by India, they faced intense propaganda calling for them to renounce Pakistan and Partition. The Pakistan government announced its satisfaction and praised the resolve of its soldiers for not giving in to enemy propaganda."
 BAN_Liberation_War.20.d:0 "The senior military leaders looked visibly shaken when they informed the Prime Minister that the offensive for the liberation of Bangladesh had failed and stalled. The Prime Minister was also said to be despondent when addressing the nation about the situation. Reports of riots and agitation are already occurring across the nation, especially in Calcutta as there is a feeling of disbelief. The Pakistan government is already praising its forces for successfully preventing national humiliation and are calling on India to withdraw its forces. The United Nations and other major powers are also calling for us to withdraw our forces as they are seen as distracting and impeding a final resolution to the East Pakistan crisis. In the coming days the government and nation will have to do a lot of soul searching to comprehend what has occurred."
 BAN_Liberation_War.21.d:0 "A series of military reforms were announced by the Indian government following the disappointing result of the recent war with Pakistan. Working closely with Parliament, the Indian government revealed plans to expand recruitment to better mobilize resources. The Prime Minister in his own statement noted plans to release funds for a temporary increase in military spending to strengthen the national defence. Indians across the country have expressed disappointment and at times outrage over the debacle in East Pakistan. Editorials bemoan the military as still firmly rooted in colonial era thinking and failing to instill the necessary skills needed for modern warfare. Indian officers are reported to be traveling to work in civilian clothing to avoid public embarrassment and humiliation in some areas."
 BAN_Liberation_War.22.d:0 "Just days after announcing a series of military reforms, the Prime Minister released the names of many senior military commanders who are to be retired from service immediately. The Prime Minister noted these officers had either failed to perform or were in positions no longer relevant to the new Indian military. The Indian Army in particular is facing the most sackings and though the senior officers appear quite demoralized, the action has support among both the people and more junior ranks. Many young officers privately felt the senior leaders had failed to show urgency or impose discipline during the conflict which led to delays and setbacks. Many of these officers believe the failure was due to leadership and not the performance of soldiers or the Pakistani Army. A new era for the Indian military begins now."

 Yahya_Khan.4.d:0 "The CMLA of Pakistan, General Yahya Khan claimed the situation had stabilized and the political atmosphere was ready for general elections to be held in six months. He stated all political parties will be allowed to participate and campaign as long as they remain peaceful. He directed that the military would ensure no corruption or rigging takes place. The news was well-received across the country, but many observers are suspicious if the military can truly be trusted to hold the impartial election they promised."
 Yahya_Khan.5.d:0 "Millions of Pakistanis, from the hills of Baluchistan to the jungles of Bengal have come out to vote in the largest election held in Pakistani history. International observers found the voting to be smooth, peaceful, and without evidence of interference. Contrary to expectations, the Pakistan military kept its word to ensure the voting was peaceful and fair. The final results are expected to be announced soon. Political analysts predict the Awami League, led by Sheikh Mujibur Rahman will likely win the most seats, especially from its base in East Pakistan. The PPP led by Zulfiqar Bhutto is expected to win a majority in seats in the western wing, however, many believe neither side can achieve an absolute majority. There is a feeling that other regional parties and religious parties will grab a number of seats as well."
 Yahya_Khan.6.d:0 "The Pakistan Election Commission released the results of the recent general election. The Awami League, led by Sheikh Mujibur Rahman captured 160 out of 300 total seats for the National Assembly. With this majority, the Awami League can amend the constitution to whatever it wishes. The Awami League ran on the platform of their Six Points agenda, calling for much greater autonomy in East Pakistan. For much of the civil-military establishment, the Awami League is viewed as a threat to Pakistan national unity, they had no foreseen the party being able to sweep virtually all the seats in East Pakistan. Zulfiqar Bhutto captured a majority of seats in West Pakistan but his party, the PPP is still a distant second. President Yahya Khan initially congratulated the Awami League but there are already rumors of senior generals and politicians in West Pakistan demanding the President not hand over power without guarantees from Sheikh Mujibur Rahman."
 Yahya_Khan.7.d:0 "There is uncertainty in Pakistan as Zulfikar Bhutto refuses to attend the National Assembly in Dacca. President Yahya Khan is under immense pressure to back Bhutto and refuse to meet until the Awami League promises to not implement the Six Points. The Awami League however, notes it has a majority, gained through a free democratic election and it can hold the National Assembly without the PPP or the other West Pakistani parties supporting him. Sheikh Mujibur Rahman in some of his speeches has condemned the actions of Bhutto claiming he is acting against democracy and has suggested he would not hesitate to hold the National Assembly and pass the Six Points. Yahya Khan is currently in Dacca with Bhutto and Rahman seeking to negotiate a solution."

 Mukti_Bahini_Insurgency:0 "Mukti Bahini Insurgency"
 Mukti_Bahini_Insurgency_desc:0 "When the Pakistan Army launched Operation Searchlight, it ended any possibility of a peaceful resolution in East Pakistan. Those Bengali soldiers who escaped being detained managed to link up with other dissidents, including Awami League members. A Bengali government in exile has formed with the fighters organized as the Mukti Bahini. They soon initiated operations against the occupying Pakistan Army. The Pakistan government pledges to crush this rebellion and it appears East Pakistan is now embroiled in civil war."

 Bangladesh_War.1.d:0 "The Indian government announced its forces were moving into East Pakistan to halt the bloodshed and preserve life. The Indian military is already launching attacks on our forces. This act of aggression will no doubt be given a befitting reply by our forces. We will soon release a statement calling on the people to unite and defend the homeland from not just an invasion but a threat to our way of life and religion. The Indians claim they are acting because the refugee situation has reached a critical moment, but we know this is the conclusion of a months long plot to destroy our nation, first through manipulating the media, second through arming the Mukti Bahini, a military buildup, and finally this invasion. For the sake of Pakistan, we must fight till the end."
 Bangladesh_War.2.d:0 "The Pakistani ambassador delivered a letter from his President calling on the United States to provide military support as they face a massive Indian invasion. We had long warned the Pakistanis to resolve their crisis in East Pakistan but they were unwilling or unable to do so. Currently, India says their only interest is expelling Pakistan from East Pakistan, which in our eyes might be for the best in terms of regional stability. However, India aggression in West Pakistan could be destabilizing. Within the United States, the public and opposition have loudly condemned Pakistan for its actions in uprooting the Mukti Bahini rebels. It would not be popular to openly back Pakistan. Despite this, Pakistan has been a friend for many years and is aiding our efforts to engage China. Our options are to symbolically deploy naval forces and tell India not to strike West Pakistan, refuse to involve ourselves at all, or quietly offer some aircraft, tanks, and weapons to ensure West Pakistan does not fall."
 Bangladesh_War.3.d:0 "The United States announced naval forces would conduct maneuvers in the Bay of Bengal. This deployment is seen by many observers as a message for India to control its ambitions during the current war it is fighting with Pakistan. Many editorials and opposition politicians have criticized the President for his action. They feel the government is overly supporting Pakistan, which stands accused of engaging in a brutal military campaign in East Pakistan against Bengalis fighting for independence. An advisor to the President privately informed reporters the United States was not siding with Pakistan but instead tilting in its direction to prevent a complete deterioration of the balance of power in South Asia."
 Bangladesh_War.4.d:0 "The Prime Minister recently spoke extensively with the American Secretary of State. The United States expressed concerns that the current war could lead to a collapse of Pakistan, which would be detrimental to the region. We informed him that our goal was to finally halt the killings and humanitarian crisis escalating in East Pakistan. The Americans acknowledged this and stated they had no complaints of that objective. However, they made it clear that any effort to expand the scope of the conflict to seize West Pakistani territory, even in Kashmir, could see a strong American action. This blatant favoritism to Pakistan is very concerning, but it is clear we have their support with regards to our goals for East Pakistan."
 Bangladesh_War.5.d:0 "The United States ambassador informed us his government, though sympathetic to the plight our people face, cannot take it upon itself to become involved in the conflict. The Americans insist its best role is to be a friend to both Pakistan and India. Openly supporting either side would in the long-term hurt Pakistan, especially in the international arena. This is disappointing news, it is clear the Americans feel we are weak and are concerned over domestic criticism of our actions to deal with the violent, anti-Pakistan elements in East Pakistan. We cannot rely on the United States and in the future we should consider how to survive without them."
 Bangladesh_War.6.d:0 "In a surprise bit of news, we were informed that the United States President had authorized the immediate shipment of arms to aid our forces, who are currently locked in a brutal war with India. The Americans noted they cannot openly back us, as many Americans blame the current war on Pakistani actions. In addition, the United States does not wish to antagonize India, which would allow it to play a role in future negotiations. The Americans will likely not ship the arms themselves but will allow friendly states in the region to transfer the equipment to us without any hinderance. In addition, the Americans have promised to issue India a warning to not use the current conflict as a means to make territorial gains in West Pakistan."
 Bangladesh_War.7.d:0 "The United States had quietly agreed to support efforts from other regional powers to transfer American equipment to the Pakistan military as it fights India. The United States did not intervene to halt the arms transfers and privately informed those nations that what equipment they sent would be replaced by the American government. Today, the final weapons were unloaded and already there are plans to deploy these weapons to the front. The American aid is not extensive, but it will make a big difference as we fight for the survival of our nation. The United States has proven its status as a true friend of Pakistan."
 Bangladesh_War.8.d:0 "A national newspaper recently detailed our approval of regional states transferring arms to Pakistan during the current Indo-Pakistan conflict. The report noted we could have halted such transfers but instead facilitated them and promised to replenish the stocks of nations who sent arms. The report was condemned heavily by both the Indian and Soviet governments. They have accused us of escalating the crisis and fueling an arms buildup. Our ambassador to India was given a stern dressing down by the Indian foreign minister. It is clear now that we are backing the Pakistanis and this will severely hurt relations with India."
 Bangladesh_War.9.d:0 "Our brotherly friend Pakistan has requested our aid in their war against India. Our own analysts believe the conflict only occurred because Pakistan failed to resolve its domestic issues and India is likely to exploit this to its advantage. Our top advisors suggest the situation is such that an intervention would not likely change the results but prolong the suffering. We are left with three choices, we can send emergency supply of arms to Pakistan, along with a warning to India. We could also just send India a firm warning to halt its hegemonic ambitions. Finally, we could choose this moment to not say anything and leave Pakistan to face the situation on its own. In time, like a younger brother, they would realize our action was for the best."
 Bangladesh_War.10.d:0 "The Chinese government released a stinging statement condemning us and expressing support for Pakistan. The statement also warns of dire consequences for us. The military also informed the cabinet of Chinese troop movements along the border. Diplomats from states friendly with China passed a message that the main concern for China is that we do not seek territory or lands from West Pakistan. For the moment it does not appear China will intervene, but we should remain vigilant to the possibility. Regardless of the harsh wording, it is clear China is not interested in forcing us to stand down with regards to the East Pakistan crisis."
 Bangladesh_War.11.d:0 "Our friend China has stepped up and provided us with much needed military equipment. The Chinese aid is currently being processed and will be deployed as soon as possible. India is a large nation and potent threat, our military can use all the support it can get. Although a direct Chinese intervention would be appreciated, receiving this support is still quite meaningful. The Chinese government also released a statement threatening India to control its ambitions and condemning their nefarious campaign to try and destroy our country."
 Bangladesh_War.12.d:0 "The Chinese government has snubbed our request for support. Not only have they declined to offer any aid, they have even refused to offer diplomatic support against potential extortionary demands by India. This is a major setback for us and indicates we may be more isolated than we had thought. When this crisis is over we will no doubt have to reconsider the nature of our relationship with China. Some suggest we withdraw our ambassador in protest, but most of the cabinet agrees the relationship is too important to let this derail the goodwill we have established over the years."
 Bangladesh_War.13.d:0 "The Pakistanis approached the United Nations to broker a ceasefire for the current fighting. Clearly, they cannot continue fighting and want it to end. Our diplomats say if we want they can delay the United Nations for another ten days, after which we will have to accept the ceasefire. However, if we feel our objectives were met we can accept the ceasefire. Our forces and people have struggled mightily, now we must make a decision on when to conclude the conflict."
 Bangladesh_War.14.d:0 "The United Nations have successfully brokered a ceasefire between India and Pakistan. A monitoring force is quickly deploying to the region to ensure neither side violates the agreement. So far the ceasefire is holding as clashes have halted between both sides. The Secretary General welcomed the decision and expressed his hopes that the two sides can resolve their outstanding issues through dialogue. Both the Pakistani and Indian government released statements welcoming the ceasefire and praising their forces and people."
 Bangladesh_War.15.d:0 "The United Nations informed us that the government of India has requested a ceasefire for our current conflict. We can accept the offer and end the fighting immediately. This may end up being the best choice, especially if we think the situation cannot change on the ground. However, our diplomats state that if we want we can delay the ceasefire for another ten days, after which we will have to accept the ceasefire. If we feel the situation can be improved with more time, we can take this option. Our forces and people have struggled heavily."
 Bangladesh_War.16.d:0 "The commander of the Pakistani Eastern Command signed an Instrument of Surrender at the Ramna Race Course in Dacca. He signed it with the Indian military commanders looking on. As the document was signed, all Pakistani forces still active in East Pakistan began the process of surrendering to Indian forces. Pakistani civil officials are currently being detained. The Bengali population in Dacca and across what was East Pakistan are reacting with jubilation to the news. For many, this marks the end of their long struggle for independence. The news in Pakistan was muted, but there is an air of anger and humiliation over this turn of events."
 Bangladesh_War.17.d:0 "Following the humiliating loss of East Pakistan and the emergence of Bangladesh, President Yahya Khan was facing massive unrest among the people and his officer corps. Fearing either a civil uprising or military coup, Yahya Khan instead announced his resignation as President of Pakistan. He has handed power to Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, making him both President and Chief Martial Law Administrator. Bhutto, who heads the most popular party in Pakistan has legitimacy among the people and does not have to worry about a military reaction. In his opening address, Bhutto promised to restore the pride of Pakistanis and begin the process of establishing democracy and constitution for the people."
 Bangladesh_War.18.d:0 "Against all odds, the Pakistan military and people withstood the onslaught of an Indian invasion and the Mukti Bahini insurgency. During the fighting, many Mukti Bahini groups launched all out attacks, revealing them and leading to their destruction. Those forces that survived fled to the Indian lines. With India unable to make much headway, their forces have already agreed to a return to pre-war boundaries and conditions. The general reaction in West Pakistan is joy and surprise over this successful defense. In India, there is a feeling of humiliation and soul searching over the failure to end the East Pakistan crisis on their terms. However, the fighting led to a breakdown in civil governance and many Bengali nationalists are still instituting a province-wide disobedience campaign."
 Bangladesh_War.19.d:0 "The Eastern Command in Dacca is struggling to maintain order and administrate effectively. Although the Mukti Bahini are largely defeated and our supporters in East Pakistan are stronger than ever, it is clear it is only a matter of time before the internal fighting begins, especially between Bengalis and Biharis. Considering the Eastern Command must contend with this internal ethnic violence along with maintaining forces on the border, the situation is untenable. The federal government has decided that keeping the old status quo is not possible but we can control how we resolve the dispute. The first step is to open talks with the Awami League and its leader Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, still being held in West Pakistan."
 Bangladesh_War.20.d:0 "Sheikh Mujibur Rahman returned to Dacca amidst massive crowds of supporters, indicating the continued support for his cause. He arrived on a Pakistan military plane after concluding tense negotiations between the Awami League and the military government in Islamabad. The two sides agreed to a referendum in three months on whether East Pakistan will remain a part of a federation or gain virtual independence by being part of a co-federation with West Pakistan. In the agreement, the Awami League and the Mukti Bahini were given an amnesty, though certain members thought especially close to India are to be expelled. In return, the Awami League promised it would not press for independence and promised to halt all armed resistance and civil disobedience. The reaction among West Pakistanis to the agreement was hostile as many see it as overly conciliatory to a group that waged war against the state."
 Bangladesh_War.21.d:0 "The people of East Pakistan voted in a historical referendum for the future of their province. In the final tally, the people decided to remain a part of Pakistan as a co-federation. From hence forth East Pakistan will be ruled by its own assembly and Prime Minister. It will essentially be completely independent from Pakistan except in terms of its economy, joint-defense, foreign affairs, and under the same President. The Pakistan military is already partitioning itself, giving East Pakistan the East Bengal Rifles and East Pakistan Rifles as the core of its own military force. Eastern Command will soon disband and leave the defense of the province to the new East Pakistani military. The presumptive Prime Minister of East Pakistan, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman welcomed the result. However, many in West Pakistan are said to be furious that despite defeating an Indian invasion and sacrificing so many lives, the Awami League appears to have won."
 Bangladesh_War.22.d:0 "With the recent referendum in East Pakistan confirming its new status, the people of West Pakistan look forward to the return of its heroic soldiers. However, there are many, especially Zulfiqar Bhutto and his Pakistan Peoples Party which have criticized the results. Indeed, there are reports of strikes and rioting in some cities as many cannot comprehend how the military government could so casually hand power over. The President however, addressed the nation and stated the situation in East Pakistan was desperate and he acted in order to preserve Pakistan as best as he could. Bengali officers in the military will soon be given the option to join the new East Pakistan military or remain. Analysts believe this backlash is due to a conscious effort by the government to downplay the situation since the unrest began months ago."
 Bangladesh_War.23.d:0 "President Yahya Khan officially handed over power to Zulfiqar Bhutto and his Pakistan Peoples Party. This comes after several months of unrest and protest by Pakistanis angry over the decision to let East Pakistan form a co-federal relationship with Pakistan. In his statement, President Yahya noted the PPP had won the most seats in West Pakistan during the previous general election and it was time to return power to the people. He stated the military saved the nation and made the hard choices needed for its survival. In contrast to expectations, Bhutto stated he would not change the new relationship with East Pakistan and pledged the two wings will continue to prosper together. This indicates an agreement may have been reached between the PPP and the military before the handover. Bhutto also promised that he would soon begin the process of writing a constitution and returning democracy to Pakistan."

 Admiral_Ahsan_Mission.1.d:0 "Following the decisive victory of the Awami League in the recent general elections, a political crisis emerged. Many of the opposition parties, especially those in West Pakistan are refusing to participate in the National Assembly. They claim the Awami League majority gives them the power to amend the constitution at will and destroy the Pakistani state. President Yahya Khan is engaged in political talks but he recently decided to task Vice-Admiral Syed Mohammad Ahsan, acting governor of East Pakistan to develop a peace initiative that would end the current crisis. Ahsan has a positive image among many East Pakistanis and is not as hardline as other members of the military. His positive relationship with President Yahya Khan is also considered an asset as he develops a peace proposal."
 Admiral_Ahsan_Mission.2.d:0 "Admiral Syed Mohammad Ahsan presented his peace proposal to the government. The proposal was made after he held detailed talks with senior government, military, and political leaders in East Pakistan. The proposal calls for the establishment of a co-federation where both wings would have their own Prime Minister, Zulfikar Bhutto for West Pakistan, and Sheikh Mujibur Rahman for East Pakistan, all under the President. A separate civil service and military would be established in East Pakistan, with those present in the province given the choice to be repatriated back to Pakistan. Some in the government believe the proposal is too far reaching. Others argue the international community has already stated their support for the proposal and it offers a viable way to resolve the political deadlock and maintain Pakistan."
 Admiral_Ahsan_Mission.3.d:0 "After stormy discussions and heated debate, the Pakistan government agreed to embrace the Ahsan Mission proposal. Although the leader of the largest West Pakistani party, Zulfikar Bhutto opposed the plan, almost all the other leading politicians in West Pakistan embraced it. Among the military, many Army officers opposed, but the leaders in the other branches were more sympathetic. In the end when the Army Chief accepted, his subordinates fell into line. News of this acceptance is already raising hope across Pakistan and the world that a peaceful solution is at hand to resolve the East Pakistan crisis once and for all."
 Admiral_Ahsan_Mission.4.d:0 "The Awami League has long advocated for greater autonomy for East Pakistan within the nation. The recent general election confirmed the widespread support for the party among the people of East Pakistan and their desire for greater freedom. Recently, Admiral Syed Mohammad Ahsan, the military Governor of East Pakistan proposed a solution that was recently accepted by the government. Based on our Six Points, the proposal calls for the establishment of a co-federation and essentially allows each wing to be self-governed. Some in the party support the proposal as achieving many of our goals and securing our autonomy. However, others in the party argue we should reject the proposal, as we won the election and should push to receive all the political power we earned at the polls."
 Admiral_Ahsan_Mission.5.d:0 "There was a palpable mood of happiness on the streets of Dacca following news that the Awami League had agreed to the Ahsan Mission proposal for a co-federation state of Pakistan. Only days earlier the city was full of gloom and tension over the political crisis following the recent general election. With the government already supporting the plan, it is expected that a new announcement will be made in the coming days laying out the new status of Pakistan. In West Pakistan, the proposal is embraced by almost all parties except the Pakistan Peoples Party under Zulfiqar Bhutto. However, analysts worry about the opposition of Bhutto as his party won the majority of the West Pakistani seats in the recent election."
 Admiral_Ahsan_Mission.6.d:0 "Vice-Admiral Syed Mohammad Ahsan, Military Governor of East Pakistan recently proposed a solution to the East Pakistan crisis. He hoped his plan would preserve the unity of Pakistan while also providing the people of East Pakistan the autonomy they have long demanded since the Awami League first unveiled its Six Point proposal. However, his mission has failed. Some blame the opposition of hardline elements in the military along with Zulfikar Bhutto. Others are suggesting it was the Awami League which scuttled the effort, confident that its electoral domination indicates they have no need to compromise. Regardless, the effort has failed and Admiral Ahsan recently submitted his resignation in disappointment."
 Admiral_Ahsan_Mission.7.d:0 "Amid a stirring ceremony in Dacca, the President Yahya Khan and the new Prime Minister of Pakistan Zulfikar Bhutto looked on as Sheikh Mujibur Rahman was sworn in as Prime Minister of East Pakistan. This marked a new era for Pakistan after Admiral Syed Mohammad Ahsan and his proposal for a resolution to the recent political crisis transformed Pakistan from a federation to a co-federation. The two wings of Pakistan will be run by their own Prime Minister and any disputes between the wings resolved by the President. East Pakistan will have autonomy across all fields, except foreign policy and some aspects of defense and the economy. Already the Pakistan military is transferring its two East Pakistani regiments to the new East Pakistan Army and has deactivated its Eastern Command. The people of East Pakistan are said to be ecstatic over the resolution, however, there are rumors that many in West Pakistan are not happy, including the new Prime Minister."
 Admiral_Ahsan_Mission.8.d:0 "Only weeks after the establishment of a co-federation in Pakistan, the western wing, now just called Pakistan, is being wrecked by large demonstrations and strikes, especially in Karachi. Many protestors are infuriated over what they perceive is the granting of virtual independence to the Bengalis. The military government is struggling to keep these protests under control and the Prime Minister, Zulfikar Bhutto has refused to comment against them. He had long opposed the recent agreement but had been made Prime Minister due to his party, the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) winning the most seats in the last general election. He noted that Pakistan could not reverse the agreement, but the fact it occurred without the explicit approval of all Pakistanis proved the current system was flawed. Many in government service and the military are sympathetic to Bhutto. Rumors abound that some senior officers have been working with the PPP in organizing this campaign of unrest."
 Admiral_Ahsan_Mission.9.d:0 "President Yahya Khan officially handed over his Martial Law powers and Presidency title to Prime Minister Zulfiqar Bhutto. This comes after several months of unrest and protest by Pakistanis angry over the decision to let East Pakistan form a co-federal relationship with Pakistan. In his statement, President Yahya noted the military made the hard choices needed for Pakistan, but for democracy to return, it must be done by those elected by the people. Upon taking power, Bhutto promised not tp reverse the co-federation. This indicates an agreement may have been reached between the PPP and the military before the handover. Bhutto also promised that he would soon begin the process of organizing a constituent assembly to create a new constitution and restore democracy to Pakistan. In regard to the co-federation, Bhutto immediately announced the President would no longer mediate between both wings but that disputes henceforth would be resolved through dialogue between the two PMs."

 Awami_League_Win.1.d:0 "President Yahya Khan has successfully convinced Zulfikar Bhutto and the rest of the West Pakistani National Assembly members to withdraw their protest and go to Dacca to start the new National Assembly. Bhutto and his supporters opposed attending as the Awami League won a clear majority and can essentially write the new constitution as they see fit. The West Pakistanis wanted the Awami League to accept modifications to the National Assembly and guarantee that any changes they do are with the consent of all political parties. The Awami League argued it won the election fairly and should not have to compromise just because the majority supported them. President Yahya Khan chose to support the Awami League stance and it appears he successfully convinced the opposition to join, likely by using the military to pressure them."
 Awami_League_Win.2.d:0 "The Awami League used its majority to pass its Six Points as the basis for the future constitution of Pakistan. As soon as the Speaker of the Assembly announced the bill would be voted on, the opposition, including all members from West Pakistan, walked out. The leader of the opposition, Zulfikar Ali Bhutto claimed the vote was an act of political abuse and disregarded the opinion of an entire wing of the country. Prime Minister Sheikh Mujibur Rahman condemned the opposition and stated the Six Points had been the main platform of his party which won the absolute majority in the National Assembly. President Yahya Khan, largely possessing symbolic powers now, has flown to Dacca in order to negotiate from the impasse. Bhutto must decide if he will try to establish a compromise with the Awami League or launch a boycott of the National Assembly."
 Awami_League_Win.3.d:0 "Following the passing of the Six Points by the Awami League, the West Pakistani parliamentarians left parliament in protest. President Yahya Khan arrived to mediate with the Awami League and the opposition. After intense discussions, a compromise was agreed to end the constant political deadlocks impacting the country. The leader of the opposition, Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, agreed to establish Pakistan as a co-federation. This would establish two parliaments, one for each wing. East Pakistan would a lot of autonomy and be virtually self-governing. Pakistan would divide assets with East Pakistan. Although Bhutto agreed to the solution, he publicly aired his reluctance and stated the decision was made under intense pressure from the Awami League and President Yahya Khan. Privately, his supporters are spreading rumors that the military strong armed Bhutto. Regardless, it appears a solution has been reached."
 Awami_League_Win.4.d:0 "The recent political crisis over the passing of the Six Points during the National Assembly has escalated into a major crisis. The West Pakistani parliamentarians have launched a boycott and refuse to return to Dacca and the National Assembly. Their hopes of forcing the Awami League to back down and compromise has failed. Instead, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman announced to cheering crowds that henceforth the Bengali people would no longer be second class citizens, instead they would control their own destiny. He announced the establishment of Bangladesh and called on all Bengalis to unite to ensure freedom. The announcement caught West Pakistanis completely off-guard. There are already reports of Bengali crowds surrounding cantonments across East Pakistan and blocking movement of supplies and people. The government must decide to either accept this disastrous change, or try to restore order and deploy the troops."
 Awami_League_Win.5.d:0 "Following the announcement of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman for Bangladesh to be independent, Bengalis across East Pakistan began a virtual blockade of military cantonments across the province. With Pakistani forces running low on supplies, the government had to decide whether to accept the reality, or launch a military intervention. President Yahya Khan decided to accept the loss of East Pakistan and ordered the repatriation of Pakistani soldiers and officials back home. The new Bangladeshi government readily agreed and is allowing Pakistani forces to move to Dacca in order to withdraw by air and sea. The Indian government welcomed the emergence of Bangladesh, while Yahya Khan is facing a virtual revolt from his own officers."

 Mukti_Bahini.1.d:0 "Our fighters identified a Pakistani Army outpost. From this position they harass locals and block the movement of our men in the area. A commander organized an assault group. They carried out careful reconnaissance before launching their attack. The Pakistani troops had no idea what hit them, we inflicted heavy casualties as they fled from the position. Our men successfully captured arms and supplies before withdrawing. A large convoy of Pakistanis returned but by then we had long disappeared. These operations will sap the will of our enemy."
 Mukti_Bahini.2.d:0 "Our fighters identified a Pakistani Army outpost. From this position they harass locals and block the movement of our men in the area. A commander organized an assault group. Unfortunately, he was overeager and his approaching force was identified by Pakistani sentries. The prepared enemy easily repulsed our attack, inflicting casualties and taking several prisoners. This is a major setback for the Mukti Bahini in the area. The Pakistanis will grow confident from this success and expand their harassment operations."
 Mukti_Bahini.3.d:0 "With help from local informants, we identified the exact positions of soldiers from a Pakistani battalion operating in the area. An elite group of mortar operators entered the area and launched a barrage on the coordinates provided. Our radio intercepts confirmed the mortars were accurate and inflicted casualties. A number of enemy positions were abandoned due to the accurate fire. This will strengthen operations in the area and give our forces space to maneuver to more effectively operate in the area."
 Mukti_Bahini.4.d:0 "With help from local informants, we identified the exact positions of soldiers from a Pakistani battalion operating in the area. An elite group of mortar operators tried to enter the area and launch a barrage on the coordinates provided. Unfortunately, our men were intercepted by a group of Pakistani soldiers and suffered losses, including mortars which had to be abandoned in the field. This is a major setback for our operations. Pakistani forces will seek to exploit their advantage in the area."
 Mukti_Bahini.5.d:0 "We recently recruited several local officials to provide intelligence to our Mukti Bahini forces in the area. The Pakistan Army is working closely with local government authorities and are dependent on them. We are gaining impressive intelligence on troop movements and future operations. This information has already led to operational successes. We are also able to move Mukti Bahini without any risk of interception. This is a major success, we are slowly taking control of the area from the occupying Pakistanis."
 Mukti_Bahini.6.d:0 "We recently recruited several local officials to provide intelligence to our Mukti Bahini forces in the area. The Pakistan Army is working closely with local government authorities and are dependent on them. The intelligence gained made us think we were gaining impressive information on troop movements and operations. However, the officials we recruited were loyal to the occupiers. They betrayed the Bengali people. Before we realized their betrayal, the Pakistanis had successfully intercepted Mukti Bahini forces in the area. This is a major setback for our cause in this area."
 Mukti_Bahini.7.d:0 "An ambitious battalion commander identified a major Mukti Bahini outpost in their area. After careful reconnaissance, he tasked a Captain to lead the assault. The operation was a major success, the position was quickly overrun with several miscreants captured. They also left behind their casualties. Our intelligence officers were able to acquire valuable enemy documents from the site. This success has reduced Mukti Bahini operations in the area and raised the morale of the troops. The Captain will be rightly recognized for his excellent conduct."
 Mukti_Bahini.8.d:0 "An ambitious battalion commander identified a major Mukti Bahini outpost in their area. After careful reconnaissance, he tasked a Captain to lead the assault. The operation unfortunately turned into a debacle. Our forces were either tipped off or identified as they approached the position. The Mukti Bahini were well-prepared. They inflicted heavy casualties before withdrawing. The outpost was overrun but the enemy had already removed their documents and equipment from the site. This is a major setback for our operations in the area. The battalion has received reports that our soldiers are nervous to go on patrol."
 Mukti_Bahini.9.d:0 "Our intelligence agents identified a Mukti Bahini outpost deep in the jungle. The Army reported it would require a heavy convoy to assault the position so the Air Force was asked to destroy the site. After receiving the coordinates and orders, our brave pilots carried out the mission. They reported the site was successfully neutralized. We sent a small patrol to inspect the site. They identified destroyed ordinances and captured documents. There is evidence the enemy took casualties and left in a hurry. This was a major success. We demonstrated the enemy has nowhere to hide from our forces."
 Mukti_Bahini.10.d:0 "Our intelligence agents identified a Mukti Bahini outpost deep in the jungle. The Army reported it would require a heavy convoy to assault the position so the Air Force was asked to destroy the site. After receiving the coordinates and orders, our brave pilots carried out the mission. They reported the site was successfully neutralized. We sent a small patrol to inspect the site. Unfortunately, they found no evidence that the site had any Mukti Bahini presence. The local villagers are infuriated by the bombing and we believe many are now sympathetic to the miscreants. This is a major setback and is being exploited as a major propaganda victory for the rebels."
 Mukti_Bahini.11.d:0 "Our intelligence officers identified several prominent Bengalis in villages under Mukti Bahini influence. These men are true believers in Islam and the ideology of Pakistan. They are providing valuable information on prominent Mukti Bahini supporters and Mukti Bahini movements in the area. We launched a combined operation that detained a number of these sympathizers and intercepted several Mukti Bahini groups. This is a major success, we can now consolidate our control in the area. This is a major victory for our intelligence officers and a sign of exceptional military cooperation."
 Mukti_Bahini.12.d:0 "Our intelligence officers identified several prominent Bengalis in villages under Mukti Bahini influence. We thought these men are true believers in Islam and the ideology of Pakistan. They were providing what we thought was valuable information on prominent Mukti Bahini supporters and Mukti Bahini movements in the area. Unfortunately, when we launched an operation to round up rebel sympathizers and intercept Mukti Bahini fighters, it ended up being a disaster. The Mukti Bahini were not in the identified positions. More significantly, it became clear the men we detained were actually neutral. They will now be sympathetic to the enemy. The Mukti Bahini are exploiting their success and strengthening their influence in the area."
 Mukti_Bahini.13.d:0 "The Prime Minister brought together senior cabinet and military officials for a private conference. The situation in East Pakistan is rapidly deteriorating with the Pakistan Army actively fighting the rebel Mukti Bahini. The large Bengali refugee population in our territory is very heavily supporting the Mukti Bahini. Our senior military leaders believe it would not be difficult to provide them with more sophisticated arms and training, especially the former Pakistani soldiers among them. They already have plans to immediately establish training camps on our side of the border. However, some ministers are concerned. They believe we should not escalate the situation and instead press Pakistan to resolve the crisis. An escalation could cause more refugees to flee and provoke Pakistan to retaliate."
