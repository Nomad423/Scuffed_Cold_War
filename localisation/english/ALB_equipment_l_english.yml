The tank itself uses a 100mm rifled gun and has varying armor thicknesses that ranges from 205mm to 60mm. The engine itself is a 38.88 liter V-12 diesel engine and the tank uses torsion bar suspension and was capable of speeds up to 48 km/h. The tank itself was used in more than 50 armies worldwide and saw production throughout the entire soviet sphere and all of their conflicts along with it."

OKB-520 modified the T-55 design by improving NBC protection, giving it a more optimized engine, improving the turret shape, and even added more auxiliary equipment such as improved fire control and optics. Additionally, the T-55 used the 12.7 DShK HMG more often whereas the T-54 used the 7.62 SGMT gun, granting it more firepower but barring it from carrying more ammunition. The T-55 was used in just as many armies and typically saw all the conflicts that the T-54 saw."

The mission of the air force was to repel the enemy at the country's borders and to defend the national airspace. In 1970 the UPSh switched from Soviet to Chinese made aircraft, which the Albanians would only use for a short period of time before the collapse of relations between Albania and the Chinese, which as a result made maintenance even more difficult as the UPSh relied on Soviet/Chinese specialists who were more experienced in military technology."

Unlike its predecessor, it had all-metal wings with elliptical tips. By this time, the manufacture of high-strength aluminum alloys was established in the Soviet Union, simplifying aircraft operation and increasing aircraft service life."

The MiG-15 was involved in many conflicts since its introduction in the Korean War, where it proved a worthy adversary to the American F-86 Sabre and F9F Panther. A section of the Korean-Chinese border was nicknamed MiG Alley because of their prevalence in the area. Over 18 000 MiG-15s were built and used by many nations, most notably the USSR and Eastern Bloc nations. While most aircraft were decommissioned in the 1950's, some still remain in service with the North Korean Air Force."

In total 20 nations used the MiG-17, spanning Africa, Europe and Asia. Its first combat deployment was in 1958, when PRC MiGs clashed with Nationalist Chinese F-86 Sabres over the Taiwan Strait. However, the MiG-17 primarily saw use in the Vietnam war with the NVAF and PLAAF were it scored 28 aerial victories. The MiG-17 was so successful that it even held its own against the much more modern, supersonic American Phantom II fighters of the Vietnam war. The MiG-17 was generally decommissioned in the 1970's, while it still remains in limited service in some African nations and North Korea."

In operation, the Yak-17 had most of the same faults as its predecessor, including relatively low speed and range, and an unreliable engine (still based upon the German Junkers Jumo 004) with a complicated starting procedure. On the other hand, its handling was very simple, and similar to popular propeller fighters such as the Yak-3 and Yak-9. This made it an excellent transitional machine to jet fighters."

The 235 aircraft that were manufactured were decommissioned by 1953. They were stripped of their engines and used in nuclear weapons testing."
