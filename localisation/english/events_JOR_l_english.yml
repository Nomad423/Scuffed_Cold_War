 Jor.1.d:0 "    Today when entering the Al-Aqsa Mosque in occupied East Jerusalem, a lone Palestinian gunman fired shots at King Abdullah I and his grandson Hussein. Hussein escaped with minor injury, but the King suffered fatal gunshot wounds and has now passed away. His son Talal will now ascend the Jordanian throne."
 Jor.2.d:0 "    After being diagnosed with schizophrenia, the parliament that he himself gave extended powers to has decided that King Talal will be forced to abdicate due to his illness. His son Hussein will now ascend the Jordanian throne."
 Jor.3.d:0 "    Today King Hussein has sadly passed away from lymphoma and other medical conditions. Huge crowds gathered outside his hospital as he was pronounced dead, and he just recently made his son Abdullah the Jordanian crown prince, succeeding his brother Hassan. Abdullah will now ascend the Jordanian throne."
 Jor.4.d:0 "    Today Talal of Jordan has reaffirmed control as the Jordanian monarch after his parliament tried to remove him by the means of a motion of no confidence while Talal was in hospital for treatment with their reasoning being that Talal was rumored to suffer from schizophrenia and thus unfit for rule. Talal has thus reaffirmed control for the time being but many are uncertain what the future will bring with Talal at the helm of Jordan."
 Jor.5.d:0 "    Today the government of Jordan has announced the ban on crabs. Military personnel were dispatched to round up and deport all crabs located in Jordan. Talal deemed crabs a threat to national security and found it necessary to formally ban them. Already crabs are being tried in Jordanian courts and anyone suspected on harboring fugitive crabs will be tried as well. When a government spokesman was asked for reasoning on why crabs are considered as a threat to national security he simply stated that it was an order from Talal and should thus not be taken into question. All around Jordan people are united in confusion and many speculate that this might just be the beginning of Talal's strange tendencies....."
 Jor.6.d:0 "    The young colonel, Gamal Abdel Nasser, has consolidated power in Egypt's Revolutionary Command Council (RCC). Nasser is pan-Arabist and a staunch anti imperialist, it's still unknown what Egypt's young new president plans but one thing is certain. A new era has just begun for Egypt and possibly, the entire Arab World."
 Jor.7.d:0 "    Ever since the Nakba and the occupation of the west bank Jordan has suffered under the strain of the Israelis and the Palestinian refugees both politically and economically. The Palestinians make up a significant portion of the total Jordanian population and are more prone to Arab nationalist and extreme ideologies. Due to the large amount of them we are unable to dislodge the most dangerous of these agitators and are thus in standoff which has created a tension within Jordan that can be felt by everyone. We must in the future decide what to do about the growing problem."
 Jor.8.d:0 "    Today military chief of staff Ali Abu Nuwar initiated operation Hashem in which Jordanian units encircled the capital Amman, when Hussein became suspicious of the troop movement and thinking that Nuwar was showing strength in order to overthrow Hussein he called on Nuwar to remove his troops and made moves to disband the Arabist government of Suleiman Nabulsi. Hussein now has to wait and see what comes of what he sees as a coup attempt against him."
 Jor.9.d:0 "    After Realizing the suspicious troop movements initiated by chief of staff Ali Abu Nuwar in which he encircled the Jordanian capital Amman Hussein was quick to order Nuwar to remove his troops immediately, which Nuwar did. Hussein then went about securing his footing by ordering the arrest of what he claimed were conspirators against him and the removal of the leftist pan-Arab sympathizing government in parliament which had, when the dust settled, secured his reign."
 Jor.10.d:0 "   Prime Minister Suleiman Nabulsi, an Arab nationalist leader was forced to resign following a struggle with the  King Hussein over who held power. The removal of Nabulsi pushed the Jordanian Army Chief of Staff Ali Abu Nuwar to activate urban Jordanians and Palestinians within the military loyal to him. He first had to neutralize the Bedouin military units loyal to the King. He first convinced King Hussein to send the main Bedouin regiment from the capital on a military exercise. When they left, he sent units loyal to him to disarm remaining Bedouin units and secure key government buildings. Despite minor clashes, the plot succeeded, and the King was soon surrounded. With his situation untenable King Hussein capitulated. In a national broadcast Ali Abu Nuwar announced his revolution, the end of the monarchy and a new Free Officers government. He added there were already in talks to unify with the United Arab Republic to meet the aspirations of the Jordanian people."
 Jor.11.d:0 "   After decades of effort the proud Hashemite dynasties of Iraq and Jordan announced their unification as the Arab Federation. Two factors proved critical in allowing this. The recent rise of the United Arab Republic and its dangerous ideology, especially among the people, pushed the both nations to recognize unification as a means to protect the people. More significantly, the young monarchs are childhood friends and it was their personal desire that provided the main impetus in its success. The Arab Federation unites the foreign policy and defense of both nations but leaves the administration in the hands of each country. This way both monarchs retain their exalted status but remain capable of countering the Arab nationalist threat whether it appears internally or on the border. Both monarchs plan on hosting each other in banquets to commemorate this historical day for the people of Iraq and Jordan."
 Jor.12.d:0 "   The ideological struggle in the Arab World took a major shift today with the announcement of an Arab Federation between Iraq and Jordan. Both nations are controlled by Hashemite monarchs who have pledged to unite their foreign and defense policies. This is seen as a direct reaction to the recent formation of the United Arab Republic (UAR). The UAR quickly condemned the new alliance, calling it a last stand of reactionary princes and calling on Arabs to rise up in both countries. The Iraqi and Jordanian government both said the Arab Federation is the culmination of a decades old dream for the dynasty and the winners will be the people of Iraq and Jordan. Pro-royal rallies were held in Amman and Baghdad to emphasize the popularity of the agreement among the people. Analysts note despite claims of a unification, the Arab Federation is principally a military alliance meant to counter the UAR."
