# Goa
 Goa.2.t:0 "Portugal Receives Report on Indian Troop Movements"
 Goa.2.d:0 "We are receiving disturbing reports from the governor of Goa regarding a massive deployment of Indian military forces along the border. He insists the risk of a military intervention appears imminent. The military notes it would be difficult for our forces to withstand a sustained campaign and dispatching reinforcements could end up using up valuable resources and leave other parts of the empire vulnerable. However, some of the leading political leaders insist we must mount some defense, regardless of the odds to avoid humiliation and signal to our enemies that Portugal cannot be intimidated out of power. The government must keep an eye on the situation and decide what realistically can be done, militarily and diplomatically."
 Goa.2.a:0 "The garrison must stay firm"
 Goa.7.t:0 "Portugal Informed Goa has Fallen"
 Goa.7.d:0 "The defense of Goa always appeared a difficult task. India surrounded the territory and infiltrated our population with hostile actors. The geographical distance made resupply and deployments arduous. The failure of the UN to hold India accountable before the conflict or during it demonstrates the global double standard. However, despite these odds, our garrison did its duty and resisted to the best of their abilities. The garrison informed us it would surrender after in the face of an overwhelming enemy force. Although our European allies and the United States offered public words of support, it is clear this is their limit. Confirming our international isolation in terms of decolonization. The people of Portugal will be devastated by the news and there will be some sense of humiliation. Already some politicians are rumbling the government must reconsider our current colonial policy."
 Goa.7.a:0 "A stinging blow"

# Macau
 Macau.2.t:0 "Should We Hold Talks with the Chinese?"
 Macau.2.d:0 "Following the 1-2-3 Riots in Macau, the Chinese residents escalated their campaign against the strong-handed Portuguese response by launching a \"n"three nos\" policy: no taxes, no services, and no selling to the Portuguese. This campaign has gained widespread support among the Chinese residents in Macau. The Portuguese government is already feeling the impact and it is clear a return to normalcy is not on the horizon. The Chinese community is demanding talks with the government regarding the future of Macau and its relationship to mainland China. Many in the colonial administration argue holding talks with the Chinese is the best way forward. Conceding to some of demands will restore order and secure our administrative role for the territory. Other officials disagree, they argue giving in to the rioters can only result in further unrest and unjust demands. A decision must be made."
 Macau.2.a:0 "Hold talks"
 Macau.2.b:0 "We will not be blackmailed"
 Macau.3.t:0 "Portugal Holds Talks with Chinese"
 Macau.3.d:0 "Following the 1-2-3 Riots and harsh military response, the infuriated Chinese residents of Macau launched a \"three nos\" policy: no taxes, no services, and no selling to the Portuguese. This campaign has spread across the whole Chinese community and is having a severe economic and social impact. The Portuguese are desperate to restore normalcy and after intense pressure, the Portuguese authorities agreed to hold talks with the Chinese as the best way forward. Although opponents argue the talks will result in more unjust demands, the government appears committed to holding talks and offering some concessions to help restore order and a continued Portuguese administrative role for the territory."
 Macau.3.a:0 "A peaceful resolution on the horizon"
 Macau.4.t:0 "1-2-3 Riots in Macau"
 Macau.4.d:0 "Several weeks ago, residents working with local leftist organizations started construction on a private school in Macau. However, a failure to allegedly pay bribes to Portuguese officials led these officials halting work on the school. Clashes immediately began between residents and police, leading to arrests and injuries. However, this all escalated yesterday. At around 1 pm, the local Red Guards, inspired by the Cultural Revolution from the mainland, began a violent riot across Macau. The rioters were joined by other Chinese residents who assaulted government buildings, tore down statues, and set fire to government documents. The Portuguese authorities declared martial law and the military has intervened. At least eight protesters are dead with several hundred wounded. The number of those arrested is unknown but thought to be very high."
 Macau.4.a:0 "Not the statues"
 Macau.6.t:0 "End of Riots in Macau"
 Macau.6.d:0 "The 1-2-3 Riots, exacerbated by the involvement of the Red Guards, attacked Portuguese businesses, government buildings, and public symbols of the colonial regime. The rioters tore down statues of Jorge Álvares and Colonel Vicente Nicolau de Mesquita. Fires burned books and colonial buildings. The Portuguese garrison declared martial law and brutally restored a semblance of order with police support. Eight of the protesters were killed with hundreds wounded. The riots are over for now, but tensions remain high and the Chinese community remains infuriated. Hopes a quick response would restore order appear unlikely as tension remains high across Macau."
 Macau.6.a:0 "Troubling times"
