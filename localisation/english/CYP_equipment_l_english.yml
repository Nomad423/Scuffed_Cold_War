 CYP_infantry_equipment_0_desc:0 "The Lee-Enfield is a bolt-action, magazine-fed, repeating rifle that served as the main firearm used by the British Empire and Commonwealth during the first half of the 20th century. It was the British Army's standard rifle from 1895 to 1957. The rifle saw extensive service throughout the Second World War, especially in the North African, Italian, Pacific and Burmese theatres in the hands of British and Commonwealth forces. Australia and India retained and manufactured the SMLE Mk III* as their standard rifle during the conflict and the rifle remained in Australian military service through the Korean War, until it was replaced by the L1A1 SLR in the late 1950s."

 CYP_infantry_equipment_3:0 "Heckler & Koch G3A3"
 CYP_infantry_equipment_3_short:0 "G3A3"
 CYP_infantry_equipment_3_desc:0 "The most well known 1963 version. Drum sights with an improved front sight, a flash-suppressor/muzzle brake capable of firing NATO standard grenades, a fixed solid plastic buttstock, and a plastic handguard that does not contact the free-floating barrel.

 CYP_infantry_equipment_4:0 "Avtomat Kalashnikova 1974 Modernizirovanniy"
 CYP_infantry_equipment_4_short:0 "AK-74M"
 CYP_infantry_equipment_4_desc:0 "The AK-74M is an improved variant of the AK-74 developed in 1991 by the Izhmash factory. The AK-74M was developed to incorporate new materials and manufacturing advances to create an improved weapon. It features a lightened bolt and carrier that reduces the recoil produced by the gas piston. The rifle also includes a glass-filled polyamide stock that can side-hold, an improved muzzle, reinforced cover, and several other minor improvements. It also comes with a rail for mounting optics. The lightened, strengthened rifle was easier to handle and carry and improved support for attachments. It did not see adoption by the Soviet Union as the USSR had crumbled before it could be considered, however, it has been adopted by the Russian Federation."
