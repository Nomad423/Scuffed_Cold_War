 DOM_MIL.1.d:0 "The Dominican Republic has requested permission to purchase new aircraft to expand its Air Force, in the face of growing regional challenges. The government has as wish list of both fighters and bombers. Although the Dominicans insist its program is for its own defense, the speeches and posture of the current government indicates it seeks such weaponry to potentially expand its influence in the region. In, our intelligence believes the Dominican government may not hesitate to use military force to resolve regional or domestic disputes. As a result, some advise we should oppose any Dominican attempt to expand its air power, either through us or our allies. Accepting the Dominican request would strengthen their resolve for anti-communism and improve ties. However, doing so may alienate other Caribbean powers and lead to regional conflicts, which could strengthen communists in the region."
 DOM_MIL.2.d:0 "The United States agreed to our request to expand the Air Force by acquiring new aircraft. The Caribbean faces increasing threats from communists, rebels, and aggressive regimes. With an expanding air force, we will be able to meet these challenges, preserve order, and protect our border. The Air Force is currently finalizing its list of aircraft needs with the United States as we insist on a rapid transfer of assets. The American government clearly sees the Dominican Republic as a vanguard for the region."
 DOM_MIL.3.d:0 "The United States rejected our request to expand the Air Force by acquiring new aircraft. We believe enemies and opponents to the Dominican nation were responsible for sabotaging this effort. A backup plan to then approach Canada for aircraft was also rejected as our former occupiers forced them to end such talks. The Dominican Republic stands at a critical juncture, facing threats on all sides, and we must be the vanguard for the Caribbean. Despite this setback, agents and diplomats will be dispatched to find alternative sources."
 DOM_Nationalism.1.d:0 "President Raphael Trujillo has long advocated a strong border, by initially expelling Haitians, and fostering a sense of patriotism among those living in border provinces. This has been done through military, economic, religious, and education policies. As part of this continuing program, the government announced a series of new incentives, calling on Dominicans to move and settle the frontier with Haiti. Since the 1930s, new schools, hospitals, roads, housing, and buildings have transformed the frontier as a showcase to Dominican culture. Teachers, professionals, and laborers are being offered incentives to boost efforts at ensuring the creation of a united Dominican nation."
 Antihatianismo_DOM.1.d:0 "Tensions with Haiti have existed for decades, however, President Raphael Trujillo has turned the common Antihatianismo sentiment among the population into state policy. After taking power in the 1930s, President Trujillo oversaw the forced expulsion of thousands of ‘Haitians’ from the border, including black Spanish speaking populations who had lived in those communities for generations. There was also widespread violence, including massacres committed by Dominican soldiers. Trujillo has also launched a large cultural campaign, with the support of Dominican intellectuals, to challenge voodoo culture with Catholicism. These actions have largely legitimized anti-Haitian violence and has put the Haitian-Dominican population in a position of great fear and insecurity."
 DOM_Political.1.d:0 "The President has directed the foreign ministry and intelligence services to dispatch resources and agents to improve support for the Dominican Republic in the United States. Our enemies have long pushed a hostile narrative of our nation, and this must be battled by any means. Our government enjoys strong contacts in Miami, especially with American businessmen with close ties to Caribbean casinos. These men have associates across the United States who can facilitate secret meetings with important congressional leaders to offer donations. In addition, these contacts can help setup operations to lure officials into compromising circumstances, especially with women. That information can also be critical in getting our perspective heard in Washington."
 DOM_Political.2.d:0 "The Vatican and Dominican Republic formally signed a Concordant. This formalizes and defines the relationship between the Catholic church and government. The agreement sees Catholicism elevated to the official state religion of the country, though Freedom of Religion remains guaranteed. The Church will receive low duties and have access to public funds. The only religious ceremonies recognized by the government will be those conducted by the Church. As Catholicism is deeply engrained in the lives of most Dominicans, the agreement is being widely praised by the population. President Raphael Trujillo hopes the agreement strengthens his popularity and will ensure the Vatican remains of limited influence in the political affairs of the state."
 DOM_Cuba.0.d:0 "In a stunning, brazen display of violence, the mercenary Caribbean Legion attempted to launch aninvasion of our nation from Cuba. The Cuban government blatantly supported the effort, providing equipment, arms, and leadership for the armed thugs seeking to ruthlessly overthrow our democratic government. The plot only ended after our diplomatic efforts convinced the United States to step in and force the Cuban government to act against the invaders. Only days later, the Cubans released the mercenaries. We strongly believe in non-interventionism, but the Caribbean Legion and their ambitious members, led by Cuba, are hell-bent on its present policy of violence. The Dominican Republic must be prepared for future attempts of foreign intervention."
 DOM_Cuba.4.d:0 "The Dominican Republic has requested immediate aid as it deals with increased hostility from Cuba. The Dominican President noted the Cuban government already backed a failed communist plot to invade his nation and is no doubt seeking other avenues of aggression. He wants immediate support to strengthen his government and demonstrate to foreign threats the United States remains committed. Our analysts believe the current Dominican government is firmly anti-communist and accepting their request will strengthen their regime from potential communist threats, as there were prominent communists among the Caribbean League plot. However, it should be noted that providing such aid may alienate other regional powers, including Cuba, and may embolden the Dominican Republic to consider its own campaign of military adventurism, which could lead to wider instability."
 DOM_Cuba.5.d:0 "The United States agreed to provide us immediate aid as we face a threat from Cuba and communist thugs. Our intelligence on the communists involved in the recent plot helped sway the United States to make the right decision. Once again, a plot meant to break our nation has not only been thwarted but we have emerged stronger than before."
 DOM_Cuba.6.d:0 "The United States, despite the clear evidence our national security is at risk, refused our request for immediate aid. The American government claimed it did not see our situation as requiring an influx of aid, noting the recent incident involving the Caribbean Legion had been dealt with before an armed conflict occurred. They also dismissed our concerns about the role of communists in the plot. The United States is clearly punishing our independent foreign policy and are also no doubt involved in plots against our people. Despite this setback, we will remain steadfast in ensuring peace and prosperity."
 DOM_Cuba.8.d:0 "President Trujillo of the Dominican Republic has offered financial support to aid us in the struggle against the communist bandits. They claim to recognize the existential threat this ideology poses to the Americas and want to help us in the struggle. This support shows we are not alone in the world and at least the Dominican Republic cares for the interests of the Cuban nation. Despite this great news, there are some who are suspicious over the intentions of Trujillo and whether it is wise to accept anything from his regime."
 DOM_Cuba.20.d:0 "The Cuban revolutionaries have made no secret of their disdain to the Dominican Republic. Fidel Castro continues to threaten our regime and their recent attempt to spark a rebellion indicates they will not hesitate to export their revolution. President Trujillo, in his vigilance to defend his nation, has called on the Dominican Republic Armed Forces to begin preparations to liberate Cuba and avenge their recent aggression. The brave armed forces are to increase their readiness as plans are developed. Whether the plan will be a direct action or covert operation will be decided in the coming weeks."
 DOM_Cuba.22.d:0 "Dominican Republic strongman, President Trujillo, has requested our aid in his plan to liberate Cuba from Fidel Castro. Trujillo is furious over the recent Cuban incursion on his territory and statements from Havana urging Dominicans to rise up. The Dominican Republic has in recent years built up its military capabilities but are desperate for an influx in military aid and advisors to take the next step in a potential effort to liberate Cuba. Our analysts believe Trujillo is mostly desperate to strengthen his own position, but he is committed to opposing Cuba. However, it is skeptical if aid will make a major difference and it might only embolden revolutionaries to expand their operations in the region."
 DOM_Cuba.23.d:0 "The United States has agreed to provide military aid and advisors to support our project to liberate Cuba from the communist cabal led by Fidel Castro. This aid will greatly strengthen our capabilities and provide a major boost to the project. More importantly, this support enables our brave soldiers to stand strong against any machinations. More importantly, this expansion in ties gives us access to American intelligence assets who will play a key role as we continue our preparations. Castrol will rue the day he decided to challenge the Dominican Republic."
 DOM_Cuba.24.d:0 "The United States has declined to provide military aid and advisors to support our project to liberate Cuba from the communist cabal led by Fidel Castro. They cite the situation is not suitable for such an operation but that may change in the future. This is a blow to our planning and capabilities. The Americans are not willing to recognize the threat Cuba poses as it no doubt plans to export its revolution. Despite this setback, we will remain vigilant and committed to the cause of securing the Dominican Republic from the existential threat posed by Cuba."
 DOM_Cuba.25.d:0 "After intense discussions and planning, we have decided that the best way forward to the liberation of Cuba is to utilize mercenaries. These contract soldiers have the capabilities to achieve our goals and not allow the Cuban dictatorship to rally the population against a foreign invasion. The mercenaries will form the core of a new Caribbean Legion. Once we pick who to contract, they can be secretly brought to the Dominican Republic and undergo the necessary training for the mission. The mercenaries, once established, must link up with anti-Castro Cuban fighters. Once a beachhead is established, then our forces can join the fight. Among the leading candidates are Osvaldo Ramirez, who is growing increasingly disenchanted with the regime and William Morgan, an American who joined the revolutionaries."
 DOM_Cuba.26.d:0 "Osvaldo Ramirez, who fought with Castro and his thugs has fallen out with the regime. He is disillusioned with their turn towards Marxism and recognizes their policies as being detrimental to the Cuban people. His extensive experience and position as a senior commander make him an ideal choice to rally a strong opposition force to join our mercenaries once they establish themselves on the island. Intelligence contacts on the island, facilitated by the CIA, state Ramirez can be easily persuaded, especially if he is offered cash to organize opposition forces."
 DOM_Cuba.27.d:0 "Commandant William Morgan is an intriguing asset already established in Cuba to help organize opposition forces to help us liberate the island from Castro and his cabal. An intelligence report indicates Morgan would support our efforts for a large sum of money. Once half the money is deposited, Morgan will guarantee that those within the Cuban government who oppose Castro will be ready to join our mercenary forces. With a contact already in place, we can begin the final phases of preparations for the liberation of Cuba."
 DOM_Cuba.28.d:0 "Our mercenaries are continuing their preparations for the liberation of Cuba. The plan calls for the anti-revolutionary Cubans to launch an uprising against Castro, once it begins, the mercenaries can then be airlifted into Cuba. Once these forces establish a beachhead, Dominican forces can then directly intervene to help lead the liberation of Cuba. President Trujillo is said to be giddy with excitement, especially with news that arms are being smuggled to anti-Castro forces from Miami. The mercenary presence and their training remain a secret to the wider world."
 DOM_Cuba.29.d:0 "Our operation to liberate Cuba has been called off. Commandant Morgan, who was our key contact in organizing an anti-Castro uprising has completely betrayed us. The American revolutionary has been feeding the details of the plan to Castro from the beginning, betraying the plot and helping Castro liquidate his opponents in the country. The Cubans attempted to lay a trap for the Caribbean Legion, but we recognized their machinations and called off the invasion before it led to a greater disaster. This is a major disappointment."
 DOM_Cuba.32.d:0 "Our mercenaries were successfully inserted into Cuba to join with anti-Castro Cuban fighters. These forces have established a beachhead on the island. We can now declare our role and join the fight. Orders are being given for the swift deployment of soldiers to help complete the liberation of the island from the Cuban revolutionaries. President Trujillo plans to address the nation and armed forces. It is time for the Dominican Republic to take its place and save the region from a hostile regime."
 DOM_ELECTS.1.d:0 "The Dominican Republic announced it will soon hold general and presidential elections in the country. Although the government are calling the polls democratic, it is understood Dominican generalissimo and current president, Rafael Trujillo is in complete control as he has largely destroyed any viable opposition over the years. The President will step down, but will retain his control over the military and ruling Dominican Party. President Trujillo would prefer his brother, General Hector Trujillo, be elected and rule through him. However, some advisors suggest he instead go with Joaquin Balaguer, a deeply loyal political ally. Blatantly selecting his brother may lead to international criticism and Balaguer can be counted on. As President Trujillo considers who to select as president, he must either go with his family or put his trust in an ally."

 DOM_Political.0.d:0 "Following controversial elections, Hector Trujillo has been elected" President of the Dominican Republic. He was the only candidate running after his brother and former President Rafael Trujillo picked him as his successor. Rafael Trujillo has ruled his nation with an iron fist, crushing all opposition and consolidating his control over the ruling Dominican Party and military. The results are being widely criticized across the Latin America world, with many accusing Trujillo of ruling the Dominican Republic as a complete dictator."
 Antihatianismo_DOM.2.d:0 "Dominican Republic strongman Rafael Trujillo is visiting the Haitian capital Port-au-Prince, symbolizing a complete transformation in relations between the two nations. Trujillo, who for decades suppressed Haitians and their culture, has recently completely changed policy. The Dominican Republic has lifted its strict ban on Haitian language and cultural traditions. The borders have also been relaxed, with new programs meant to facilitate the movement of workers. While many in Haiti continue to hold Trujillo responsible for the anti-Haitian massacres of the 1930s, the warm reception he received indicates his new policies are winning him new support. The Haitian government noted the visit cements the strengthening bond of the Haitian and Dominican people."
 Trujillo_Foreign_Assasinations.1.d:0 "Law professor Jesus Galindez reportedly disappeared after entering a New York subway station late at night. His disappearance came after the professor expressed fears that the Rafael Trujillo regime in the Dominican Republic would send agents to remove him. Although no body has been found, investigators believe he is likely already dead. Supporters of the victim, political leaders, and congressional members are all putting the blame on the Dominican Republic government, which has denied involvement. Galindez was a major critic of the Trujillo family and nearing completion of a new book exposing their corruption. An FBI source pointed out a Dominican ship had docked and left New York in a matter of hours, during the time the alleged kidnapping occurred. The United States government has recalled some of its diplomats and cancelled meetings to be held with Dominican officials, expressing their anger over the incident."
 DOM_OAS.2.d:0 "Following the election of Joaquin Balaguer as President of the Dominican Republic, the new leader has vigorously sought to repair the image of his nation internationally. Many members of the Organization of American States accuse the Dominican Republic of being a repressive dictatorship under Rafael Trujillo with wider regional ambitions. There have also been a number of protests by student groups across Latin America against political repression in the country. President Balaguer promises change, noting his efforts to slowly bring in democratic reforms and he has indicated a desire to engage with other nations through cooperation not aggression. Although it is not clear how the OAS will react to these overtures, many in the Dominican Republic would welcome an opening of ties across the Latin American world."
 DOM_Cuba.1.d:0 "In recent weeks, reports from Cuba indicate over a thousand Cuban and Dominican revolutionaries were undergoing training exercises in preparation to invade the Dominican Republic. This force, part of the Caribbean Legion, is said to be interested in ending the rule of Rafael Trujillo and restore democracy in the Dominican Republic. Cuban authorities had done nothing to stop the preparations, leading to criticism from the Dominican government. After the United States put pressure, the Cuban government arrested the Caribbean League fighters, ending the plot. Though within days virtually all the fighters were released from prison. The initial lack of effort and quick release of the prisoners is said to have infuriated Rafael Trujillo."
 DOM_Cuba.3.d:0 "The Dominican Republic has launched a major diplomatic offensive against the Cuban government. In scathing statements, its officials accuse Cuban officials of blatantly interfering in the internal affairs of the Dominican Republic and supporting armed aggression against the Dominican people. This comes weeks after the United States pressured Cuba into stopping the Caribbean Legion from going through with a plan to land over a thousand Dominican and Cuban volunteers to overthrow the regime of Rafael Trujillo. The Caribbean Legion had been using Cuba as their base of operations and making no effort to hide their efforts. An official from the Cuban government noted it is not their responsibility to police or control the passions of foreign nationals and that perhaps it is the Dominican government that should adjust its own policies."
 DOM_Cuba.15.d:0 "After over a week of fighting, the Dominican Army reported it has defeated a Cuban-backed invasion of the island. The fighting began when a plane carrying sixty Dominican and Cuban revolutionaries landed in the Dominican Republic. A week later, more fighters arrived by yacht, seeking to spark a general uprising against the Dominican government. These forces were quickly dealt with by Dominican forces. The Dominican government swiftly condemned Cuba and with American support, will call for an emergency Organization of American States meeting. Dominican leaders insist Cuba will be held to account and they are confident the OAS will support their efforts to condemn Cuba for trying to violently export their revolution."
 DOM_Batista.1.d:0 "Former Cuban President Fulgencio Batista fled with his family and allies to the Dominican Republic as his regime fell to Fidel Castro and his revolutionaries. The arrival of Batista, along with his retinue and huge amounts of cash has irked Dominican strongman Rafael Trujillo. As Batista works on making arrangements to secure a visa, he is being held in a luxury hotel, under careful watch by Dominican forces. Trujillo has made it clear that if Batista wishes to leave the hotel for wherever he secures his visa, he must provide payment to the Dominican Republic to recoup its loses. A refusal to make payment will result in dire consequences, though Batista and his allies are unsure what that would entail."
 DOM_Batista.2.d:0 "The exiled former Cuban President Fulgencio Batista has left the Dominican Republic for Spain where he and his family received visas. Reports indicate Batista had to leave millions of dollars for Rafael Trujillo in order to leave the Dominican Republic. The Dominican strongman apparently felt the need to demand a ransom after discovering the vast amount of cash taken by the Batista family as they fled Cuba. Observers note that Batista and his clique were being held at a luxury hotel but with strict restrictions on their movements."
 DOM_Batista.3.d:0 "Dominican Republic authorities reported former Cuban President Fulgencio Batista has passed away from natural causes overnight. Batista recently fled to the Dominican Republic after being ousted from power by revolutionaries. Those who fled with Batista, including close allies and family, are said to have already left the country for Spain, without the body. Reports suggest Dominican authorities seized cash from the Cuban exiles before allowing them to leave. More menacingly, rumors suggest the death of Batista may not have been natural. His family was not allowed to view or take possession of the body. One Batista aide told reporters the former President had been taken into custody the night of his death. In addition, Dominican leader Rafael Trujillo is said to have demanded a ransom from Batista. Perhaps Batista refused, resulting in his execution by the Dominican government."
 DOM_OAS.1.d:0 "The relationship between the Organization of American States and the Dominican Republic has reached a new low. Many OAS members remain critical of President Hector Trujillo, noting his election and policies suggest his brother and former President, Rafael Trujillo remains firmly in charge of the government from behind the scenes. In particular, OAS members have raised concerns over the continued consolidation of power by the Trujillo family and their involvement in suspicious activities. The Dominican government has rejected these concerns, accusing the OAS of bias and active interference in the internal affairs of the Dominican people."
 DOM_Cuba.21.d:0 "Dominican Republic leader Rafael Trujillo proudly announced the creation of a new Caribbean Legion. He called the multi-national force essential for securing the interests of all democratic loving people and noted the group brings together peoples from across the region. He noted the force stands ready to defend not just the Dominican Republic but also Haiti from any attempt by the radical regime in Cuba to export their revolution. The Caribbean Legion will also stand ready to aid the Cuban people when they recognize the corruption of Castro and his cabal. The Caribbean League is not part of the Dominican government and is an independent organization. Analysts suggest the Dominican government is seeking to create plausible deniability as the group is likely under the complete control of Dominican authorities."
 DOM_Cuba.30.d:0 "The Cuban government announced it had thwarted an attempt by the Dominican Republic to invade Cuba. According to reports, Cuban authorities discovered a plot by Dominican authorities to cause an uprising, send in mercenaries, and then deploy its own forces once a beachhead was established to overthrow the government. However, the man hired to organize the Cuban uprising, Commandant William Morgan, ended up betraying the Dominicans and leaking all the information to the top Cuban officials. After Cuban security forces identified those planning to join the planned uprising, hundreds were arrested, purging the government of many anti-Castro elements. Cuban authorities also presented arms and cash allegedly sent by Dominican agents to confirm its claims. The Dominican government has refused to comment, though reports indicate its leadership is infuriated by the massive failure."
 DOM_Cuba.31.d:0 "Reports from Cuba indicate an armed battle has erupted between the Cuban military and a rebel force. The rebels are said to be disgruntled Cuban fighters who oppose the rapid shift towards Marxism occurring under Fidel Castro. Cuban authorities claim the rebels are being backed by the arrival of mercenaries being flown from the south. They believe the uprising and mercenaries indicate a foreign plot, likely originating in the Dominican Republic. Dominican authorities deny the accusations, stating the Cuban government will blame everyone but themselves for pushing people into action."
 DOM_Cuba.33.d:0 "Dominican ruler Rafael Trujillo addressed the nation, stating that the Dominican Armed Forces will soon join the fight to liberate Cuba from Fidel Castro, declaring war on Cuba. In his address, Trujillo pointed out the Dominican Republic was itself a victim of Castro who attempted to spark an uprising only months ago. If the Dominican people did not act now, the next attempt could see a massive Cuban invasion of either the Dominican Republic or Haiti. He praised Cuban opposition fighters for their bravery and stated he would not abandon their brave struggle. The Cuban government issued a blistering statement against Trujillo, stating it is now clear the entire uprising was an orchestrated, foreign plot. All Cubans are being urged to stand up and fight any invasion force."
 DOM_Cuba.34.d:0 "The Dominican Republic confirmed it no longer had active forces on Cuba and hostilities had ceased. Dominican officials refused to comment further. The Cuban government is said to be in a boisterous mood, with captured prisoners, equipment, and weapons being paraded around Havana. Fidel Castro thanked the brave Cuban soldiers and people for uniting to stop an invasion orchestrated by the Dominican dictatorship. Cuban authorities also stated it can confirm Dominican involvement from the beginning, claiming to have prisoners who can confirm they were mercenaries paid and inserted by Dominican authorities once the initial uprising occurred. Leaders in other nations are criticizing the Dominican Republic, with one diplomat calling the entire plot hairbrained" and without merit." The fate of those captured remains uncertain."
 DOM_Cuba.35.d:0 "Cuban rebels, backed by the Dominican Republic, successfully seized power from the revolutionary regime of Fidel Castro. Cuban fighter Osvaldo Ramirez Garcia is the newly proclaimed President of Cuba. He has promised to quickly restore peace to the nation, return it to the international community, and reverse the extreme policies of the previous regime. The Dominican Republic welcomed the news and congratulated the Cuban people for their freedom. The fighting began after Dominican forces intervened in support of an anti-Castro uprising in Cuba. At this stage, it is widely recognized that the entire plan was likely directed and implemented by Dominican leader Rafael Trujillo who wanted to avenge an attempt by the Castro regime to infiltrate revolutionaries in the Dominican Republic. For Trujillo, the victory in Cuba solidifies his status as a major player in Caribbean international politics."
