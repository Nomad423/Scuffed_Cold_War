 PM_Shastri.1.d:0 "Indian National Congress leader Lal Bahadur Shastri passed away overnight. A spokesman gave no details, only confirming the opposition leader passed suddenly. Shastri is a Congress veteran, had been running the Congress Party after the passing of Jawaharlal Nehru. His experience, quiet demeanor, and political savvy made him a very effective political leader. Although all indications are his death was from natural causes, rumors are circulating that Shastri may have been the victim of a conspiracy. The Congress Party plans on holding immediate talks to determine a new leader for the party. Indira Gandhi, the daughter of Nehru, is the clear favorite to take over and try to lead the party back to power."
 goa.1.d:0 "After centuries of suppression, the Indians of Goa are clamoring for freedom. Pro-India strikes and protests continue to demand the Portuguese end their reign on the territory. Indeed, officials in the area report large numbers of Indians are leaving Goa for freedom and to escape violence. In order to prevent instability and to demonstrate our resolve, the government has approved orders to deploy military forces along the Goa border. The presence of our troops will raise morale and give a clear warning to the Portuguese that they cannot act with impunity."
 goa.2.d:0 "The military commander in Goa sent an urgent report to Lisbon. He detailed a large mobilization of military forces by India on the Goa border. The number of troops, equipment, and positioning clearly indicate these are not defensive deployments. This puts our forces in Goa in a desperate military situation, as they are outnumbered, outgunned, and miles away from support. We must treat carefully from here on out as India appears strongly interested in a military option. Civilian officials also sent a report noting the India media appears to be working with the government in demonizing our presence."
 goa.3.d:0 "Goa had long been a blemish on the map for the people of India. Patriotic Indians did not understand how European colonial colonies could exist next to a free India. In this situation, the Indian government sought a resolution with Portugal, but they refused. Eventually, Operation Vijay was launched. Despite seemingly large military advantages over the Portuguese, the operation failed. Never since the Battle of Plassey had an independent Indian power suffered such a stunning defeat to a European power. We must reassess our military. Many argue the it retains too many of its colonial era practices and structure, it lacks a national spirit. Despite having so many officers with combat experience, the military utterly failed in what appeared to be an easy task. Portugal is jubilant and look forward to dictating terms, we must lick our wounds from this humiliation."
 goa.4.d:0 "When news reached Lisbon of the military victory in Goa, the people jubilantly began celebrating. The Indian invasion presented the greatest challenge to the policy of militarily fighting decolonization. Our forces faced a veteran enemy with advantages in size and geography. Despite these daunting obstacles, our forces, expertly led, with highly motivated troops, achieved what seemed impossible, a successful defense of Goa. The government policy to refuse negotiations with India now appears vindicated. Observers note the victory strengthens the government and makes Portugal appear as a tenacious power globally. Militarily, valuable experience and more importantly, confidence has been achieved. Now Portugal can successfully dictate to India and preserve Goa."
 goa.5.d:0 "The defense of Goa was always going to be a difficult task. The territory is surrounded by India and the population hostile to our presence. The UN failed to hold India accountable for its aggressive policies before or during the conflict. Our own allies ignored pleas for help when the Indian military mobilized offensive forces on the border of Goa. However, despite facing daunting odds, the garrison did their duty and resisted as best as they could. Today the government was informed our forces surrendered after exhausting its capacity to resist. Although our European allies and the United States offered condemnations, it is clear their reaction will not go beyond diplomatic. The people of Lisbon understood the task to be very difficult but are still expected to be quite dejected as the news sinks in."
 goa.6.d:0 "The tiny nation of Portugal defied the predictions of all observers and successfully defended its colony in Goa from an invasion by India. The Indian Army, despite possessing advantages in all categories, most importantly in geography, could not successfully marshal these into a successful intervention. For months tensions had increased as pro-Indian residents in Goa were increasingly protesting Portuguese rule in Goa. The Indian Army, after mobilizing, launched Operation Vijay (Victory) to firmly resolve the issue but were stunned by the ferocious Portuguese defense. The success of Portugal has emboldened the government and its standing with its citizens. While in New Delhi the government faces angry speeches by the opposition and across the country, government officials along with military personnel are said to be facing verbal abuse at the humiliating defeat."
 goa.7.d:0 "Goa had long been a blemish to the people of India. Patriotic Indians were infuriated by the idea of European colonial enclaves existing next to a free India. After Portugal refused all diplomatic overtures, and with tensions mounting, the Army began mobilizing on the border. Soon after, Operation Vijay was launched with the intention of liberating Goa from nearly 500 years of Portuguese colonialism. The Indian military showcased its modern training and military strength by defeating the Portuguese rapidly. The people of Goa supported the troops as they advanced, and the victory resulted in a feeling of mass euphoria across India. The operation demonstrates the Indian state has the capacity to swiftly resolve regional disputes through military options, which will no doubt make states respect what we can do."
 goa.8.d:0 "450 years of Portuguese colonial presence in India formally ended following the successful Indian capture of Goa. The independence of India sparked the rise of nationalism among Indians in the Portuguese colony Goa. Its attempts to discuss the status of Goa were constantly refused by Portugal. However, during recent unrest, the Indian military built a sizeable force around the colony, and ordered an intervention, citing a need to protect Indians in Goa. After a brief conflict, the much smaller Portuguese garrison capitulated. Portuguese efforts to rally international support failed as few nations had an appetite to support a colonial power. Across India, there is a feeling of pride and joy for the successful eviction of a colonial power from the subcontinent and the military prowess of the Indian Army."
 goa.9.d:0 "The Indian government announced after exhausting all efforts at a peaceful resolution, it is deploying its armed forces to liberate Goa from almost five centuries of colonialism. In recent months, Portuguese authorities have struggled to handle protests and strikes by local pro-Indian subjects. Observers feel the Indian Army enjoys a major advantage in numbers, equipment, and experience. The Portuguese government condemned what it terms is Indian aggression, pledging its garrison will repel any attack. Portugal for years has rejected any talks with India over Goa, a major setback may represent a blow to the current government. For Indians, the operation will allow India to flex its muscles as a regional power."

 india.50.d:0 "Nathuram Vinayak Godse, an advocate of Hindu nationalism who assassinated Mahatma Gandhi in 1948 has just been sentenced to death by hanging. Godse was put on trial at the Punjab High Court, at Peterhoff, Shimla. Although pleas for commutation were made by Gandhi's two sons, Manilal Gandhi and Ramdas Gandhi, they were turned down by India's prime minister Jawaharlal Nehru, deputy prime minister Vallabhbhai Patel and the Governor-General Chakravarti Rajagopalachari, and Godse was hanged soon after at Ambala Jail."

 Tripura.1.t:0 "Tripura Merger Agreement"
 Tripura.1.d:0 "The State of Tripura was one of the ancient princely states of India. According to the Rajmala, Tripura was ruled continuously by as many as 184 Tripuri Kings with sovereign and independent status prior to its merger with the Indian Union in 1949, after the death of the last ruling King, Bir Bikram Kishore Debbarman. His successor, Kirit Bikram Kishore Deb Barman, was thirteen years old at the time of the merger. King Bir Bikram Kishore Debbarman had died in 1947, after which a Council of Regency was formed to run the administration under the presidency of Queen Kanchan Prava Devi, the mother of Kirit Bikram Kishore Deb Barman.\nWithin a few months after the unnatural demise of King Bir Bikram Kishore Debbarman, Tripura faced a great crisis, with threats from internal as well as external forces. Queen Kanchan Prava Devi, as president of the Council of Regency, came under severe pressure to opt to join the Indian Union. On the advice of the Government of India, she dissolved the Council of Regency and became the sole Regent on 12 January 1948. More than a year later she signed the 'Tripura Merger Agreement', and with effect Tripura became part of Indian Union. It was thereafter administered by the Chief Commissioner as a 'C' Category State."

 india.2.d:0 "India achieved independence from British Raj on 15 August 1947. The independence came through the Indian Independence Act 1947, an Act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom that partitioned British India into the two new independent Dominions of the British Commonwealth. India obtained its independence on 15 August 1947 as a constitutional monarchy with George VI as head of state and the Earl Mountbatten as governor-general.\nOn 29 August 1947, a Drafting Committee was appointed to draft a permanent constitution, with B. R. Ambedkar as chairman. A draft constitution was prepared by the committee and submitted to the Constituent Assembly. The Assembly met, in sessions open to public, for 166 days, spread over a period of two years before adopting the Constitution. After many deliberations and some modifications, the members of the Assembly signed two hand-written copies of the document."

 India_Elects_70s.1.d:0 "The Indian people took to vote in what many believe is the most hotly contested election in Indian history. The election sees the Congress Party led by Indira Gandhi go against Moraji Desai and his Janata Party. The Congress Party is running on a platform calling for a more socialistic transformation of India. The Janata Party promises to restore India in the vision of Mahatma Gandhi and condemns Congress for seeking to implement a foreign ideology on the people of India. Janata promises a return of traditional Indian values and protection for Indian industries and agricultural producers. The people of India must decide on more socialization or a push for the India envisioned by its earliest freedom fighters."
 India_Emergency.20.d:0 "Citing the ongoing instability and economic crisis, the Indian government under Prime Minister Indira Gandhi announced a suspension of all elections. The main urban newspapers have roundly criticized the decision. However, pro-Congress media outlets spoke loudly in support. The opposition is calling for mass protests in the coming days with many politicians accusing the government of delaying polls until they establish total control. The Congress Party in response called on its own supporters to prepare their own events in support of the government during this critical time. It appears the political situation in India remains unstable and uncertain."
 India_Emergency.17.d:0 "Prime Minister Indira Gandhi declared the Emergency was nearing an end and fresh elections will be held in a few months. She has directed the government to release all political prisoners to allow a free and open election campaign. Indira Gandhi is portraying the election and lifting of Emergency restrictions as a natural progression. She stated her hopes that the people will confirm their support for Congress in the election. However, the opposition is claiming it was pressure from the Indian people that forced the government to hold elections. Almost all the opposition parties are already claiming the upcoming election will be between continued dictatorship or democracy."
 India_Emergency.1.d:0 "Judge Jagmohanlal Sinha issued a verdict in the State of Utter Pradesh v. Raj Narain case. Raj Narain, who lost his election for the lower house of parliament to Prime Minister Indira Gandhi appealed against the huge electoral victory of Gandhi. He alleges Gandhi and the Congress Party used government resources, bribery, and other means to ensure her two to one victory over him. The judge, in a stunning verdict, agreed with Narain and has voided the victory of Gandhi. Indira Gandhi is barred from taking the premiership. The judge has ordered the Congress Party to pick a new premier within 20 days. The opposition and Congress believe if the verdict is accepted, new elections must be held. Indira Gandhi could accept the verdict, or she could appeal to the Supreme Court, which will allow her to remain Prime Minister. Her advisers believe if she appeals, she should declare a state of emergency to prevent instability and ensure the neutrality of the courts."

 Sikkim_Accension.1.d:0 "The leader of the Sikkim National Congress Party (SNCP) has appealed for the Indian government to complete the integration of Sikkim to India. This follows recent acts by the Indian parliament to reshape the relationship of Sikkim to India of that from a protectorate to a state within the Indian Union. The Chogyal of Sikkim continues to resist such attempts, calling instead for a free and fair referendum on whether Sikkim should remain a protectorate or join the Indian Union. The Indian Prime Minister must decide whether to respond to the SNCP, which was elected by the people and intervene, or to step back and refuse to directly intervene."
 Sikkim_Accension.2.d:0 "The capital of Sikkim was abuzz with excitement and fear as its people saw Indian troops enter the city and secure key government buildings, including the palace. The Indian government deployed its forces after receiving a request from the elected representatives of Sikkim and amid fears that the situation may deteriorate into clashes. The Indian Army claims its forces are only there to protect the people and not interfere in their affairs. The move is being strongly condemned in some circles as a blatant intervention the affairs of Sikkim. However, many Indians applaud the government for better facilitating the integration of a new state for the Indian Union. The Indian Prime Minister announced a referendum on the future of Sikkim will be held soon to determine the future relationship of Sikkim and India."
 Sikkim_Accension.3.d:0 "Under the oversight of the Indian Army, the people of Sikkim voted on whether to join the Indian Union or remain a protectorate. After tabulating the results, over ninety five percent of the people voted to join the Indian Union. Pro-Indian supporters took to the street to celebrate the results, though some of the more pro-monarchy neighborhoods were noticeably quiet. Some observers noted the circumstances of the vote appeared rushed and there are rumors that the Indian government manipulated the ballots to achieve a complete electoral victory. Regardless, the monarchy of Sikkim is abolished and India will soon welcome a new state to the union."
 Sikkim_Accension.4.d:0 "The Indian parliament voted to pass a new constitutional amendment to officially integrate Sikkim as the newest state in the Indian Union. The previous protectorate relationship has been lifted and the governance of Sikkim will occur according to the laws of India. This completes the long process of integrating the former colonial princely state into India. There was universal support in parliament for the amendment and the integration of Sikkim is being viewed as a great success for the Prime Minister. The Chinese and Pakistani governments have condemned the recent acts as an overt annexation."

 INC_VICTORY.1.d:0 "The recent legislation passed during the Emergency was recently confirmed by the Supreme Court. This is a major victory for the Congress government. In recent years, the Congress Party and Indira Gandhi worked hard to weaken the powerful Indian judiciary. Judges using their power to interfere in politics and government have been removed and new legislation has limited judicial oversight. This latest victory confirms their efforts in controlling the judiciary were successful. Opposition leaders strongly condemned the court rulings, with some accusing the judges of being rubber stamps for an undemocratic regime."
 INC_VICTORY.2.d:0 "The Congress Party old guard and opposition are from a different era of politics in India. Many, despite proclaiming a leftist view are still the products of colonial schools and ideas. A new generation of young Congress activists are emerging as strong supporters for Indira Gandhi and her efforts to engage with the Indian people more directly. These are men and women educated in an independent India. This rising youth wing is being led by the son of Indira Gandhi, Sanjay Gandhi. In recent weeks, many of these highly motivated party workers were promoted or appointed to senior positions both in the Party and government. Although the Prime Minister is lauding the development, many older Party members are growing concerned of the radical ideas being promoted. One editorial by a retired Congress stalwart even accused the Prime Minister of solidifying total authority over the Congress Party."
 INC_VICTORY.3.d:0 "The Congress Party sent a delegation, led by a top Sikh party official to hold talk with select Sikh leaders. The Sikh community has risen in strong opposition to the Emergency, holding demonstrations and accusing the government of fascistic tendencies. Although many of the prominent Sikh opposition members did not attend, some moderate leaders did attend. The government assured them there was no intention of subverting Indian democracy. In addition, promises were made to drop legal proceedings and release some of the Sikhs arrested in protests. The talks did not resolve tensions in Punjab but have reduce tensions between the Sikh community and the Congress Party."
 India_Econ.6.d:0 "A federal development board is debating whether to promote industries in either Bombay or Madras. Both are major cities and their national politicians are putting immense pressure on the Prime Minister to push for their city. Bombay and Madras are both historical port cities with immense cultural and political influence. Selecting Bombay would strengthen the Prime Minister and his relationship to the powerful business and film industry. Supporting Madras would endear the Prime Minister to southern India and its ties to other major Indian Ocean trading posts."
 India_Econ.7.d:0 "A federal development board is considering where to invest in new steel factories in the country. The two cities are Delhi and Bangalore. Delhi on paper appears ideal considering its history as a major industrial center and location to the capital. However, Bangalore is a historically vital city of southern India. Building the steel works there would solidify the relationship between northern and southern India. The Prime Minister must decide which site to build."
 India_Econ.8.d:0 "The financial regulators and Finance Minister have approached the Prime Minister. They note the rapid growth in banking the country and a need to promote for financial institutions. Gujrat and Hyderabad are being touted as potential locations to encourage the establishment of new banks and financial markets. Gujrat is historically a major trading hub and such an investment could lead to a boon in trading to the middle east. Investing in Hyderabad would open opportunities to locals in the region to access financial institutions. The Prime Minister must decide."
 India_Econ.11.d:0 "The federal government is facing intense backlash from newspapers and regional political parties in southern India. They are writing reports emphasizing the tendency of the federal government to invest in north Indian states. Many of the more aggressive writers are claiming south India is becoming a semi-colony to the needs of north Indians. The Prime Minister has denied these accusations and his political allies in the south are speaking out. However, it will take a long time for the Indian government to rebuild its ties with the people of south India."
 India_Econ.12.d:0 "The federal government is facing intense backlash from newspapers and regional political parties in northern India. They are writing articles condemning the government for overreacting to concerns among south Indian states of being neglected by the traditionally north Indian dominated federal government. More writers are claiming the north Indian states are being punished for being at the forefront of liberation and are being shackled by this bias and quotas. The Prime Minister has denied these accusations, claiming the decisions were based entirely on impartial analysis. However, it will take a long time for the Indian federal government to rebuild its ties with the people and governments of northern India."

 KashmirIND70.1.d:0 "The situation in Kashmir remains in limbo. Our forces do remain in control of key areas, however, the Pakistanis continue to occupy key areas of the territory. They are also adamant in their ambitions to steal the entire province and are fomenting unrest among Kashmiris. Senior defence, political, and intelligence leaders recently met to discuss the situation. One option is to focus on the internal security in order to prevent potential uprisings, especially those sponsored by Pakistan. Such a focus would also expand our base of support among the Kashmiris. The second option is to consider a limited offensive across the border. Such an action could improve our position on the border and demonstrate to the Pakistanis the futility of pursuing a military solution in the future."
 KashmirIND70.25:0 "The police and intelligence agents in Srinagar identified several key student and political agitators either advocating for Kashmiri independence or unification with Pakistan. These agitators regularly organize meetings that occasionally turn into public demonstrations. One option is to arrest these agitators, this could curtail any protests in the foreseeable future. However, it might backfire and provoke more unrest. The other option is to just keep tabs on the protestors and accept the current rate of protests, intervening in ways to prevent them from expanding."
 KashmirIND70.26:0 "The recent arrest of public agitators in Kashmir has had a profound impact on unrest in the region. The lack of leadership has caused a decline in organized meetings and public protests. It appears the remaining hardcore activists are unable to spread their message to the people. We do expect a new crop of leaders to eventually emerge, but this will take time and it appears our operation has completely uprooted the protest infrastructure in Srinagar. The arrests also uncovered that some of the leaders were sponsored by Pakistani intelligence."
 KashmirIND70.27:0 "Following Friday prayers, thousands took to the street in Srinagar for protests over the arrests of leading agitators in the city. Our operation to arrest these agitators did not result in a decapitation of protest leadership. Instead the remaining agitators, developed a plan to spread word of the arrests and use the Friday prayer sermons as a venue to encourage unrest. The protests are much larger in scale than previously and have garnered attention from the international media. The Pakistanis are using this to spread their own propaganda. We will likely have to release some of the agitators to calm the tensions."
 KashmirIND70.30.d:0 "India has initiated radio broadcasts targeting our presence in Kashmir. They are portraying our liberation of Kashmiris as an occupation that caused the separation of families in the Kashmir valley. More significantly, the Indians are providing false propaganda that Kashmiris in India enjoy full democratic rights, while Pakistani Kashmiris are under military occupation. An effort is being made to counter this narrative, but for some Kashmiri families who have found their land occupied by soldiers or families separated, they are finding the messages appealing. There are also increasing student protests calling for more autonomy and administrative rights for the Azad Kashmir government."
 KashmirIND70.2.d:0 "One of our procurement officers abroad, while visiting a producer of mountain scaling equipment for some purchases, noticed several pieces of equipment with Indian military markings. Upon quietly inquiring with some of the employees, he discovered that India was making a substantial order of mountain warfare equipment. We do not know what this means, but the size of the order and timetable indicates the Indians may be plotting some misadventure. Perhaps on its Himalaya borders or in Kashmir. Some in the GHQ are urging a redeployment of forces to the Kashmir front just in case, however, other generals argue such an overreaction may leave other fronts open to Indian aggression."

 PostSimla.1.d:0 "Prominent Kashmiri leader Sheikh Abdullah and Prime Minister [IND.GetLeader] signed an agreement called the Sheikh Accords. The agreement comes following the recent military victory of India over Pakistan. With the strategic balance of power now turning firmly in the favor of India, the Kashmiri leader decided he had to reach an agreement. The agreement calls for the implementation of constitutional amendments to begin formally integrating Kashmir into India. The first area of Kashmir to be brought into the fold as an Indian state will be Jammu. The path to formal annexation and integration has begun for Kashmir. The Pakistanis and Kashmiri nationalists are denouncing the agreement as a capitulation by Sheikh Abdullah."
 PostSimla.2.d:0 "Amanullah Khan, a UK based Kashmiri nationalist, recently founded a new organization called the Kashmir Liberation Front in Birmingham. Khan is a noted nationalist, having been a part of an airplane hijacking of an Indian Airlines flight before escaping to England. He is revered by the large Kashmiri community in the country. The group is quickly gaining in popularity and is setting up chapters across Western Europe, Pakistan, the United States, and the Gulf. The organization currently is not engaged in direct conflict with the Indian state but is growing, organizing, and campaigning for Kashmiri political rights. It is only a matter of time before the Indian government will have to deal with this group directly as its publications are gaining popularity in Srinagar and the Kashmir Valley."
 PostSimla.3.d:0 "The National Conference (NC) decisively won state elections in Indian Jammu and Kashmir. Observers note this was the freest elections held in the state since India the former Princely State acceded to India.  The NC is the oldest political party in the state and claims to represent all the people of the state. The electoral victory is a major victory for the Indian government as the NC is a close ally to New Delhi. Kashmir activists abroad and in Pakistan will be disappointed by the result. Indian newspapers are lauding results as confirmation that the Kashmir disputed has firmly been resolved in the favor of India following its victory over Pakistan."

 Janata.1.d:0 "The Janata Party coalition recently repelled Emergency-era laws restricting worker or political strikes. The Prime Minister stated that strikes and acts of civil disobedience played a vital role in the independence of India and in ending the Emergency. As these activities allow the people to be heard, it is not the place of government to interfere or restrict such activities. He added this continues his vision to see India return to the vision Mahatma Gandhi had for the nation. Business and factory owners are said to be disappointed by the decision, claiming there is nothing to stop political infiltrators to manipulate workers and take advantage to use strikes as a means to cripple the economy in support of more radical agendas."
 Janata.2.d:0 "The Indian government is considering presenting legislation to Parliament requiring foreign corporations to enter into partnerships with Indian corporations. Supporters of the legislation claim it will promote local industrial growth and promote self-efficiency. They argue foreign corporations would gladly comply with the law to enter the large Indian market and that such relationships will help Indian industry rapidly modernize. Opponents to the legislation fear the potential domestic industrial boom promised by proponents of the bill will not materialize and foreign corporations may end up leaving the Indian market. The Prime Minister must decide whether to go with the legislation, if he refuses though, he will face backlash from the party."
 Janata.3.d:0 "The recent legislation that required foreign corporations to enter partnerships with local Indian corporations has backfired. Coca Cola and IBM are among the higher profile foreign firms that have announced they will leave India. The companies cite the new Indian laws as too disruptive to growth and have chosen to leave the Indian market. The Indian government tried to put a brave face claiming that Indian producers will make up consumer demand for such goods. Economists offer a more pessimistic assessment. They note the lack of foreign goods, will hinder the economic development of India. The lack of foreign firms will hurt technological access and hinder the ability of Indian corporations to compete with goods on the international market."
 Janata.4.d:0 "In recent weeks, the ruling Janata Party passed constitutional amendments undoing those passed during the Emergency. The government notes these amendments were meant to legitimize an undemocratic seizure of power and give extraordinary power to the executive. The new reforms are meant to restore credibility to the judiciary and ensure future efforts to undermine Indian democracy cannot occur. The Prime Minister claimed India had firmly restored itself as the largest democracy in the world. The move is being largely welcomed in the media, though several opposition leaders raised concerns that they would now be open for litigation."
 Janata.5.d:0 "The Janata Party consists of socialists, pro-business, regional, and religious parties across India. It has conflicting interests and a number of coalition partners with opposing viewpoints. Despite its victory, the Janata Party is currently ruling with a weak coalition. Recently, left-leaning Janata MPs have indicated they may not always vote with the party in parliament. There are fears that the Congress Party may exploit this to their advantage and undermine the legislative agenda for the government. The Prime Minister has called for a meeting of all major coalition partners and Janata leaders to find a solution and strengthen the coalition."
 Janata.6.d:0 "The Prime Minister sought to shore up support within the Janata Party and its coalition allies, particularly with its left-leaning members in a recent meeting. However, these efforts failed and the left wing of the party now adamantly states it will not guarantee its vote on all matters, especially those related to the economy. They continue to condemn the Congress for its autocratic structure but claim they cannot betray the Indian worker for political gain. The government sought to assuage their fears and promised a balanced economic program, but the left-wing members refused to compromise on their stance. The Prime Minister will have to deal with an even weaker coalition and more difficult legislative battles in Parliament."
 Janata.7.d:0 "The Prime Minister sought to shore up support within the Janata Party and its coalition allies, particularly with its left-leaning members in a recent meeting. The talks were a major success as the left wing of the coalition agreed to not withdraw their vote in support of government bills they find too pro-business or capitalistic. However, they agreed on the condition that Janata curb some of its proposed legislation and continue to support efforts to protect worker rights in India. This is a small compromise and the Prime Minister can rest assured his coalition is now much stronger than when it started."
 Janata.8.d:0 "The Janata Party announced a series of new reforms for the intelligence agencies in the country. Military officers attached to these agencies will be moved from certain posts and replaced by civil officials. There will also be more direct oversight over these agencies by the cabinet. Domestic operations are all to be ceased immediately, including ongoing investigation. The government hopes these reforms will enable intelligence operatives to focus on foreign threats and no longer be abused by any future government as it had during the Emergency. Moving military officers will also prevent any military interference in domestic affairs."
 Janata.9.d:0 "The Prime Minister setup the Mandal Commission to identify the socially or educationally backward classes in India and present recommendations on empowering these groups. The commission identified specific castes that are falling behind in social development, education, end economically. The final report recommends a series of reforms. One calls for the prevention of predatory loans towards disenfranchised castes. The more controversial recommendations call for the establishment of quotas to government positions and educational institutions. If the Prime Minister decides to begin implementing the proposals, he risks receiving backlash from those communities who do not fit the category of a backward class but also feel disenfranchised. The other option is to just file away the Mandal recommendations and leave them for another government, which will anger those communities."

 IND_PRC70s.1.d:0 "The new Indian government led by Moraji Desai has requested to send a delegation to visit. The new Indian government wishes to launch confidence building measures in order to improve relations and facilitate peaceful resolutions to our current issues. Many of our foreign relations experts believe we should meet with the Indians as improving relations could open up access to trade with India and its extensive market. Others believe it would be more in our interest and the Pakistanis would appreciate if we rejected this initiative."
 IND_PRC70s.5.d:0 "An Indian delegation recently arrived in the capital for high-level talks meant to normalize relations between our states. The Indians have also brought some of their top economic officials and are calling for an expansion of trade opportunities. The Indian government has not been shy to discuss its interest in normalizing our relations. We have three options. We can choose this opportunity to normalize ties, through an expansion of cultural exchanges. Or we could normalize ties and sign some trade agreements to boost potential trade between our nations. The first two options could help pave the way to future agreements. The final option is to politely receive the mission and send them back without any agreements and maintain the status quo. This will help ties with Pakistan and show our position towards India."
 IND_PRC70s.4.d:0 "The recent diplomatic mission to China arrived in New Delhi to much fanfare. The mission successfully achieved a diplomatic breakthrough, including an agreement for more cultural exchanges. The Indian government has placed normalizing ties with China as one of its major foreign policy objectives and it appears their effort is bearing fruit. The two nations also agreed to expand their embassies to better facilitate travel and engagement between the two states. Critics to the Prime Minister acknowledge his success but note the agreements do not mark a significant shift in ties nor resolve the current outstanding issues between the two states."
 IND_PRC70s.3.d:0 "A high-powered delegation of senior Indian government officials and politicians arrived for talks in the capital. The Indians are keen to normalize ties and begin building trust between our two states. The Indian delegation insists the Prime Minister is keen on a breakthrough in bilateral relations between the two most powerful Asian powers. We must decide whether to reciprocate and begin the process of normalizing ties. We would do so by signing an agreement to increase cultural exchanges between our states. Such an agreement would reduce the potential for conflict with India but may alienate Pakistan. The other approach is to politely host the Indians and then send them off without any commitments, leaving the status quo intact."
 IND_PRC70s.2.d:0 "The Chinese positively reacted to our request and have formally requested we send a delegation. This marks a major breakthrough in Indo-Sino relations. We must decide what type of diplomatic mission to send. We can send one led by our Foreign Minister to work on normalizing diplomatic relations and cool existing tensions. The material benefits would be limited in a diplomatic mission but it has a high probability of success. Or we could send a mission dominated with economic officials to press for a new economic agreement. Expanding economic links could be a way to achieve economic growth and positive ties. The economic mission may offer more rewards but is highly risky and could easily end in failure."
 IND_PRC70s.6.d:0 "The recent diplomatic mission to China arrived in New Delhi to much fanfare. The mission successfully achieved a diplomatic breakthrough, including an agreement for more cultural exchanges. In addition, both sides agreed to encourage trade ties through several treaties. The Indian government has placed normalizing ties with China as one of its major foreign policy objectives and it appears their effort is bearing fruit. The two nations also agreed to expand their embassies to better facilitate travel and engagement between the two states. Critics to the Prime Minister acknowledge his success but note he did not achieve a resolution on the more serious outstanding issues. The government claims achieving such an agreement requires steps to be taken and India has taken large strides."

 India_Emergency.2.d:0 "Prime Minister Indira Gandhi and her government gave permission for the President to proclaim a state of emergency across India. The government cited economic crisis caused by recent strikes over the recent political turmoil. The threat of renewed conflict with Pakistan was also cited as a reason for the emergency. This is an unprecedented change and is already causing opposition politicians to call for more strikes and resistance. The Prime Minister is accused of proclaiming the emergency to prevent her removal of power due to the Raj Narain verdict."
 India_Emergency.3.d:0 "The courts recently confirmed the State of Emergency proclaimed by the Indira Gandhi government. Judges who did raise concern were superseded by pro-government judges quickly elevated above them. The courts are also approving arrest warrants by the government under the emergency. The continued effort of Indira Gandhi to replace and stack judges in her favor is being greatly criticized by the media and opposition. Regardless, the strengthening of the government control over the judiciary gives Gandhi immense power."
 India_Emergency.4.d:0 "The Indian government has argued that there is an emerging security crisis necessitating the expansion and continuation of emergency rule. Indira Gandhi argues the rise in strikes and dissent, along with security concerns regarding Pakistan mean that India is facing an internal emergency along with a international one. The Prime Minister has requested the President to extend the emergency every six months until the situation has stabilized and democracy can flourish."
 India_Emergency.5.d:0 "Despite vehement criticism from the opposition, it appears the government argument regarding the need for an emergency is gaining traction among the public. In recent weeks, more pro-government editorials and reports on the escalating security crisis are being widely read by the people. Indira Gandhi and her government appear to be stronger than ever, with extensive powers. The public is also expressed satisfaction with what they see is the arrest of corrupt politicians and officials by the government. The opposition will have to re-adjust its approach on confronting the government."
 India_Emergency.6.d:0 "The major newspapers across India have launched a sustained editorial campaign criticizing the Indira Gandhi government. They point out the emergency appears to be the result of political setbacks not a real need to protect the nation. Many accuse the government of killing the democratic spirit of India. More troubling for the government is the publishing of opposition condemnations of the government. If the public supports the opposition, the Indira Gandhi government faces major challenges in maintaining the emergency."
 India_Emergency.7.d:0 "Indira Gandhi held a private meeting with the top officers of the Indian Army. She pointed out the reasons for the emergency and asked the military for its reaction to the situation. The Indian Army has a long history of being apolitical and professional, the Prime Minister expressed her hopes this would remain. The Indian Army and its top brass are faced with a difficult choice. While most officers are inclined to remain uninvolved, there are those who fear for the democratic future of the country. They urge the Army Chief to use his influence and suggest the Prime Minister consider ending the emergency and hold elections. However, to do so would be a major break from tradition."
 India_Emergency.8.d:0 "In a major victory for the Indira Gandhi government, the Indian Army declared it would remain apolitical. This is confirmation that the military is not being swayed by the opposition, though it is not likely to actively aid the government in cracking down on opponents. The military is strictly focused on protecting the borders from foreign threats. News of the Army refusing to act will reduce some of the tensions and provide a blow for those opponents who hoped for a military intervention to finally end the emergency."
 India_Emergency.9.d:0 "In a private meeting with the Army leadership, Prime Minister Indira Gandhi was informed the military preferred elections. This marks a major setback for Indira Gandhi and the Emergency. The implication is a failure to call elections could result in either a military intervention or public refusal of military support, both disastrous scenarios for the government. Shortly after the meeting, Prime Minister Indira Gandhi addressed the nation and announced her recommendation the President lift the Emergency. New elections will be held immediately. The Army and government will not want to reveal the details of the meeting as that could disrupt the Indian political structure. If the opposition or general public found out it could lead to both anger at the Army for intervening and a new precedent that the opposition could call on the Army to resolve political problems in the future."
 India_Emergency.10.d:0 "Sanjay Gandhi, the son of Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, continues to concentrate power during the Emergency. He was one of the strongest advocates for declaring an Emergency and with key advisors defecting to the opposition, his position has greatly solidified. The Prime Minister trusts her son completely, however, he is publicly perceived as corrupt due to his familial ties and previous involvement in controversial government initiatives. Sanja Gandhi has also unveiled a five-point agenda to promote efforts in improving literacy, family planning, among other social improvement initiatives. Many observers are nervous of the increasing prominence and power being held by Sanjay."
 India_Emergency.11.d:0 "Following the Emergency, the Indian government is seeking to break the traditional political machines operating across the country. Many regions of India are dominated by the political machines of mainstream political parties. This process prevents open competition in many areas and forces citizens to choose between voting for a party or losing access to state resources or bribes offered by the parties. Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, under the urging of her son, Sanjay Gandhi, has begun dismantling these party machines through arrests and new regulations. This allows the Prime Minister and her supporters to directly engage with the population and not through the party apparatus, which consists of many opponents to the government."
 India_Emergency.12.d:0 "Prime Minister Indira Gandhi unveiled a Twenty Point Program in order to guide India out of its current crisis. The Prime Minister insists the implementation of the program will help guide the nation out of the current Emergency. The plan is focused heavily on the economy and is designed to boost the production of agriculture and the industry. Improving public services and rooting out corruption are also a major objective. The program is being well-received, however, the opposition are accusing the government of manipulating the people."
 India_Emergency.13.d:0 "Following the proclamation of the Emergency, the Indira Gandhi government has directed police across India to arrest dissidents. Perceived extreme political organizations, like the Indian Communist Party, the RSS, and Jamaat-i-Islami are finding their events being banned and leaders imprisoned. Activists discovered to be involved in organizing strikes or national protests are being arrested in the thousands. Even opposition politicians are being arrested on dubious charges of corruption and instigating unrest. There are widespread reports of police torture. Media outlets are said to be facing similar threats, with some media organizations becoming mouthpieces for the government. Although the government is removing its enemies, the public is said to be seething with what they see is an attack on civil liberties."
 India_Emergency.14.d:0 "The efforts by Indira Gandhi and her government to restore order with a declaration of an Emergency faced a setback in Amristar. Thousands of Sikhs gathered in the city to condemn what they call the fascistic tendencies of the Congress Party. The event, called the Campaign to Save Democracy is being recognized as one of the first major mass protests against the government. The Indian government has already begun directing police to arrest Sikh activists. Despite being a small minority, it is clear that a large percentage of those arrested are Sikh, causing intense resentment from the Sikh community to the government."
 India_Emergency.15.d:0 "Efforts by the Indira Gandhi government to directly engage with the population, bypassing traditional political infrastructures and new social reforms have gained traction among rural Indians. For urban Indians, there is still a great deal of resentment over what is seen as the erosion of Indian democracy. However, there is some support for the government among business owners who support new initiatives to revive the economy. The arrest of dissidents and crackdown on the opposition has hindered efforts to resist Indira Gandhi, overall the national strikes and protests have diminished."
 India_Emergency.16.d:0 "The government of Indira Gandhi is facing accusations of overseeing the forced sterilization of millions in the countryside. There are reports from villages accusing government doctors of sterilizing women without informing them. The current Family Planning campaign is believed to be under the control of Sanjay Gandhi and he is facing the brunt of criticism. There are protests across affected rural communities and newspapers are widely publicizing stories of individuals victimized by the program. Local officials are facing crowds of protestors outside their homes. Sanjay Gandhi is being accused of incompetence and corruption, with many believing his position is the result of nepotism."

 India_Kashmir70s.50.d:0 "In a secret gathering of the top political, defence, and intelligence officers, discussion was held on what to do in Kashmir. The military presented that they had made the necessary logistical preparations for a campaign in Kashmir and our intelligence on the front was very high. They stated the decision now rested with the Prime Minister on whether military action is warranted. Local offensives could prove a powerful demonstration to Pakistan of our resolve, however, a failed operation could see the Pakistanis gain territory and prestige. If the Pakistanis appear too dug in or look like they may be considering their own offensive, the current operation can be transitioned from offensive to defensive. We must make a final decision."
 India_Kashmir70s.51.d:0 "The Indian Army launched offensives in Kashmir. The Indian government released a statement emphasizing the operations were limited and meant to punish Pakistan for its continued interference and provocations in Kashmir. The Pakistan government was quick to condemn the Indian attack and promised its forces would deliver a befitting reply to the Indian attack. The international community will watch the situation closely as there are fears any fighting between the two could quickly escalate into a general war."
 India_Kashmir70s.52.d:0 "Our government announced it had successfully wrestled key border territories from Pakistani forces along the in Kashmir. The Indian Army recently launched its limited operations in response to Pakistani efforts to foment uprisings and to demonstrate the futility of military force for their forces. Parliament has already sent a note of congratulations to the government and military for its actions. The Pakistanis are dismissing reports they had suffered a defeat, but our troops are clearly in control of some key border areas. The international community is satisfied that the conflict did not escalate. The Indian people will view this success with great admiration."
 India_Kashmir70s.53.d:0 "The Indian Army launched a nefarious scheme that culminated in their unprovoked aggression along the Kashmir border. Our forces fought bravely and with discipline, but were unfortunately pushed back in several sectors. We will condemn the Indian aggression internationally and minimize the losses to our people, but it is clear that the Indians stand in control of some new territories along the border. We must reassess our military situation and political direction in order to retake these territories and ensure no further acts of Indian aggression occur in the future."
 India_Kashmir70s.54.d:0 "We have directed the Foreign Ministry and Defence Ministry to minimize its comments following confirmation from the Army our forces were pushed back slightly in Kashmir. Our plan to punish the Pakistanis and improve the military situation in Kashmir through a limited offensive failed. In the ensuing Pakistani counterattack, their forces managed to take some territory. Our plan has completely backfired, the Pakistanis and their agents in Kashmir will be emboldened for further aggression. The Indian military has pledged to be especially vigilant. We can expect public backlash and parliamentary anger over this failed operation, more significantly, the military situation in Kashmir has shifted."
 India_Kashmir70s.55.d:0 "The Indian Army sought to use trickery and brute force to drive back our troops in Kashmir. Despite their efforts and surprise, our brave soldiers not only stopped their advance but also counterattacked, taking some key strategic positions along the border. We are already publishing pictures across the media of Pakistanis officers and soldiers posing on positions once occupied by the Indian Army. One advisor proposed a bold plan, we can offer to return the newly captured territory if India agrees to implement the UN Resolutions on Kashmir. India may now consider the military situation unsustainable and accept. The other option is to simply hold the territory and prepare for a future operation to completely liberate Kashmir."
 India_Kashmir70s.56.d:0 "The Pakistani government has offered to return the territory it seized in our recent border conflict In Kashmir in exchange for the implementation of the UN Resolutions on Kashmir. Hardline officials are urging us to reject the proposal, claiming we will be able to retake the lands in the future and an open vote would likely go against us. However, more moderate leaders believe this may be an opportunity to resolve our dispute with Pakistan in Kashmir. They believe we should trust our friends among the Kashmiris to vote with us and the implementation of the resolutions would likely not result in the complete loss of Kashmir. Another group of officials simply believe we should reject the proposal as that would set a precedent that states can blackmail us with territory to achieve goals. We must decide how to respond."

 Nagaland_Unrest.1.d:0 "In 1946 an agreement was made between the Nagas community and Assam government. Nagas were given control over their land, along with executive, legislature, and judicial powers. The agreement was to last 10 years, after which a new agreement would be made. Naga nationalists interpreted this to mean in 10 years they gained independence, causing a conflict in the late 1950s. We eventually created Nagaland as a state under the constitution in the early 1960s, calming the tensions. Unfortunately, a new wave of Naga nationalism is sweeping the state, with reports of armed bands forming. We could deploy security forces to engage the rebels or make an agreement granting wider autonomy to the state for the near future."
 Nagaland_Unrest.2.d:0 "Our security forces are engaged in armed conflict with the so-called Naga Federal Army guerrilla force. These misguided Naga nationalists are launching attacks and sabotage operations targeting government facilities and police outposts. We are deploying military forces and establishing checkpoints. However, our military experts believe the insurgency will not pose a major threat as the Army can easily blanket the region. It will just take time to pacify the province. The political Naga leaders are condemning our response, making baseless accusations of human rights violations."
 Nagaland_Unrest.3.d:0 "The security situation in Nagaland has stabilized. Naga nationalist leaders are more interested in continuing peaceful discussions with the government. Many of the militant fighters are frustrated by staying in the field and are desperate to return home. More importantly, civilian populations are beginning to turn on the rebels, largely exhausted by the military checkpoints and curfews. Although the rebels have not been defeated, they are melting away. As we stepdown operations, our troops and resources in Nagaland can now be redeployed for the national cause."
 Nagaland_Unrest.4.d:0 "With rumors of a fresh insurgency building in Nagaland, the government reached an agreement with Naga leaders. The government has agreed to temporarily grant extensive autonomy to Nagaland, for the next ten years. To avoid any misunderstandings, the Naga leaders agree that after ten years, the administration will revert to the previous model, unless a new agreement is reached. The Nagaland government explicitly promises to not demand independence or promote separatism under this agreement. The agreement is being criticized by some as a capitulation, however, others are praising us for showing political maturity with regards to the Nagaland situation."
 nagaland_agitation:0 "Nagaland Agitation"

 NCO_71.1.d:0 "The United States continues to use their wheat aid as a means to pressure our government into obedience. This leads to public embarrassments and puts into question the independence of India. For many patriotic Indians, this relationship resembles how the British manipulated and treacherously stole the subcontinent centuries ago by abusing trade relationships to their advantage. In consideration to these intolerable circumstances, the Prime Minister announced plans to end United States wheat shipments and aid effective immediately. The Prime Minister noted this would cause initial hardship to the people and economy, but that Indian institutions would adapt. The announcement galvanized many Indians, especially on the left, though some conservative politicians accused the government of sacrificing the access of food for millions just to gain political points."
 NCO_71.2.d:0 "In a recent interview published in newspapers across India, Prime Minister Moraji Desai laid out his vision for Indian foreign policy that many are dubbing the Desai Doctrine. The Prime Minister noted the freedom fighters of India, Gandhi and Nehru both believed in an India not dependent on any foreign powers and self-sufficient. He also noted India should not have an interest in interfering or involving itself in the affairs of others so as not to harm those people as the Indian nation was by imperialism. Instead, India would step back from deep relations with superpowers and instead look regionally to promote peace and prosperity for Asia. Many see this last statement as a veiled criticism of previous governments which sought close ties with either the Western or Soviet camp. The Prime Minister concluded by reiterating his desire for regional peace and noted his efforts at normalizing ties with China. The Chinese government warmly welcomed the statement." 
 INC_71.1.d:0 "Prime Minister Indira Gandhi and her ministers in recent weeks unveiled what many in the media are dubbing the ‘Indira Doctrine.’ India will firmly draw a firm line across the Himalayas and ensure this strategic area does not fall to hostile powers. To support this endeavor, the Indian government will support the independence of the Himalayan states and work as their partner. Critics in the region accuse India of forcibly seeking to establish a hegemonic relationship and coerce loyalty from these states. Regardless, many across the country welcome these actions as proactively defending the borders of India."
 INC_71.2.d:0 "The Prime Minister was informed of recent ethnic violence in Sri Lanka that saw several intense clashes. The clashes occurred between the Sinhalese and Tamils. Many Tamils resent the political domination of the country by the Sinhalese and note their lack of representation. The lack of police involvement, especially in incidents where Tamil property was targeted only fueled the clashes. Our government must take a public stance to either support the Sri Lankan government or the Tamil community. Domestically, our nation has a large Tamil population which is sympathetic to their compatriots in Sri Lanka. If we support the government, it can help the bilateral relationship but cause some domestic anger, if we support the Tamils, than we can get some public support but our relations with Sri Lanka would drop."
 INC_Kashmir.1.d:0 "The recent conflict with Pakistan confirmed our political, economic, and military dominance of the region. We have delivered a crippling blow to the Pakistani ambitions for Kashmir and neutralized their ability to internationalize the conflict. The anti-India elements within the Kashmiri government now lack a patron and are in an equally weak position. Now is the time for Prime Minister Indira Gandhi to hold talks with famed Kashmiri leader Sheikh Abdullah, known as the Lion of Kashmir. He historically has been a threat to the Indian Union with his constant flirting with independence or even pro-Pakistan factions. Kashmiri activists have long complained their status since independence remains in limbo and frozen. These talks will allow a breakthrough and likely a just settlement for Kashmir. The negotiating position of the Lion has never been lower."
 INC_Kashmir.2.d:0 "Representatives of the Prime Minister and Sheikh Abdullah signed an accord in New Delhi regarding Kashmir. The new agreement, among its key provisions, reiterates Kashmir as a constitutional part of India, agrees that any efforts to question Indian sovereignty or insult symbols of the nation will be punished, and Sheikh Abdullah would be appointed Chief Minister. The reaction in India is widely positive with many praising the government for finally ending the self-determination movement once and for all. Among the Kashmiris, the reaction is very mixed, some support Abdullah, claiming the current regional political and strategic reality limits his ability to negotiate terms. However, there were some protests in Srinagar condemning the agreement and Kashmiri youths abroad are rumored to be meeting to form new organizations to challenge Indian rule. Regardless, the agreement cements the recent Indian victory."
 CPI_71.1.d:0 "The Prime Minister praised the passing of a new law that nationalizes all private-state partnerships in the country. The Prime Minister noted the partnerships were contradictory as one worked purely for profit while the other sought to alleviate the hardships of the workers. Now with the state in control of these partnerships, the rights of workers will be preserved and lead to the improvement of production. The former private partners will not be compensated by the state and many are bitterly complaining that the government has stolen family businesses. In addition, opposition politicians are bitterly complaining that this nationalization will cause corruption and inefficiency as the center will struggle to stay on top of all these new industries. Supporters of the government praise the action as essential to establishing an economy that is both strong and conscious of worker needs."
 CPI_71.2.d:0 "The Indian government issued a stern warning to us regarding the communist party of Sri Lanka. They have demanded we lift any restrictions and release any detained activists for the movement. This is a blatant intervention in our internal affairs and we have only detained those who pose a direct threat to the general peace and stability of Sri Lanka. The Indian threat appears genuine, we must either give them guarantees protecting the communist party and activists, or we can turn to the United States and United Kingdom for protection in this difficult time. We can offer them naval bases in exchange for a guarantee."
 CPI_71.3.d:0 "The Indian government recently issued loud threats towards Sri Lanka for their alleged crackdown of socialists and Tamils across the island. The Indian media is widely publishing reports, many unverified, describing atrocities and violence being perpetrated by the Sri Lankan government against its own citizens. The Sri Lankan government in response has refused to accept Indian demands they guarantee the communist party and release any detained activists. Their leader recently reached out to the President and requested American support in this dispute in exchange for naval base access in Sri Lanka. This would give our navy strategic ports in the Indian Ocean, however, we would risk being embroiled in a war with India."
 CPI_71.4.d:0 "The Indian government recently issued loud threats towards Sri Lanka for their alleged crackdown of socialists and Tamils across the island. The Indian media is widely publishing reports, many unverified, describing atrocities and violence being perpetrated by the Sri Lankan government against its own citizens. The Sri Lankan government in response has refused to accept Indian demands they guarantee the communist party and release any detained activists. Their leader recently reached out to the Prime Minister and asked for British support in this dispute in exchange for naval base access to Sri Lanka. This would give our navy strategic access to the region, but at the risk of an armed conflict with India. Some in cabinet are urging the Prime Minister to accept, not only for the naval access but to support our former colonial possession from a radical leftist regime."
 CPI_71.5.d:0 "The Sri Lankan government swiftly rejected our just call for justice. They defiantly stated their policies towards socialists and communists are internal matters. It also noted the Sri Lankan government cannot interfere in law enforcement or the judiciary in terms of those detained for subversive activities. The Sri Lankans also reached out to outside powers and may have secured some guarantees. Considering all these factors, we must decide if we should continue to fan the flames of anger towards the Sri Lankans or leave the situation for now until things cool down. Perhaps a more subversive route will be needed to resolve this crisis."

 IND_PAK60s.1.d:0 "The United States since Partition has established especially friendly ties with Pakistan. In order to carry out a shift in our foreign policy to a Western orientation and garner support, especially with regards to China, we must demonstrate our peaceful intentions with Pakistan. We can invite Pakistan for regional security talks. Even if the talks do not wind up achieving any results, the Americans will see it as a positive step, and it will only benefit our relations with them. However, some in the government oppose talking with the Pakistanis and worry it will hurt domestically and strengthen their global image. We must decide what to do."
 IND_PAK60s.2.d:0 "The Indian Ambassador conveyed an invitation from their government to attend a summit on the Regional Security situation. The Indians have expressed concern over outside influence and threats to South Asia and wish to discuss a way for Pakistan to join in efforts to preserve South Asian sovereignty. They noted their acknowledgement that tensions between our nations exist, but they hope cooperation in other fields may lead the way to a wider peace. We can certainly attend these talks to see what the Indians have in mind, perhaps they will be more amiable to Kashmir if we humor them. However, clearly the Indians may seek to use this to confirm a false normalization in our relations, and in that case it may be best to decline and state such talks would only be appropriate after Kashmir is resolved."
 IND_PAK60s.3.d:0 "Top Indian and Pakistani officials began talks in Calcutta over the regional security situation. In opening remarks, the Indian Defence Minister discussed how Indo-Pakistan rivalry risked making South Asia vulnerable to potential threats. Although he did not name any specific threats, many inferred he was referencing China. The Pakistani delegation in its opening remarks stated it was willing to sit and listen and hoped India understood the resolution of outstanding issues between the two nations was the key to establishing a strong, firm South Asian defence."
 IND_PAK60s.4.d:0 "The Indian government stated it understood our reservations due to current outstanding issues, and noted it was not realistic to try and resolve all those issues during these discussions. However, they did note that both nations were interested in preserving the freedom so many South Asians fought and died for. They propose that our two states mutually agree to guarantee the independence of the other for five years so that in the event of an outside invasion, the two sides can come together in mutual defence. Certainly, such a proposal would be attractive to nationalists in Pakistan, especially those involved in the freedom struggle, and it does not commit us to a formal relationship with a state we have outstanding problems with. However, we should also consider the domestic backlash and weakening of our options to resolve Kashmir if we sign such an agreement."
 IND_PAK60s.5.d:0 "The Pakistani government noted that while it appreciated the efforts of India to try and reach an agreement, they stated it was not realistic as long as Kashmir remained unresolved. The Pakistani government appreciated the invitation and intention of the Indian government but stated the circumstances made an agreement virtually impossible. The Pakistani delegation soon left, ending the talks. Although an agreement was not reached, our actions were well-received domestically and we have demonstrated our position as a peaceful world power."
 IND_PAK60s.6.d:0 "In a major breakthrough for Indo-Pakistan relations, the two sides agreed to sign a pact. Both nations will promise to defend the other in case of attack by a foreign third party. The agreement is to last five years and many across the region hail it as a major breakthrough. For India, who is experiencing tensions on its Chinese border, this agreement offers some relief to their forces bordering Pakistan. For Pakistan, they announced their intention to use the agreement as a building block from which to try and achieve further breakthroughs on Kashmir. Many Pakistani analysts have expressed disappointment and believe India achieved far more in the agreement than Pakistan."
 IND_PAK60s.7.d:0 "The Secretary of State of the United States recently called the Prime Minister to express his appreciation to our recent efforts at coordinating a South Asian defence against communist aggression. He stated that Washington had watched the negotiations closely and regardless of what happened, it is clear that India sees the world from a perspective of preserving global peace. The Secretary of State then invited senior officials from our government to visit the United States to exchange views. This is a big step in improving US ties."
 IND_PAK60s.8.d:0 "The Five Year Defensive Pact between India and Pakistan expired with little fanfare. For India the agreement helped its security position during a period of heightened tension. For Pakistan, they hoped to use the agreement to press a solution on Kashmir, however, the Indian government refused to budge on the issue, disappointing the Pakistanis. The Pakistan government in particular is happy the embarrassing agreement is no longer something people can criticize. Although the agreement has expired, experts do not expect either to engage in any military actions against the other."

 USA_INDIA60s.1.d:0 "The Indian government has requested a military mission visit Delhi and make recommendations. The Indians would prefer military hardware, which would be used to defend India from the threat of Communist China and other nefarious influences in the region. However, they also if the mission could not recommend equipment, they would also appreciate help in training up our forces. Some in the Pentagon are skeptical about involving ourselves in such a mission as the Indian government has proven quite resistant to our influence in the past. However, the State Department argues this is exactly why the United States should send a mission to hopefully begin moving India into our camp. There are wider concerns that aiding India may alienate Pakistan, who we have established close ties with."
 USA_INDIA60s.2.d:0 "The United States informed our government that they could not at this time fulfill our request to send a military mission to Delhi. This is a major setback to our efforts to orient closer toward the Western powers. Domestically, many newspapers are noting their does not seem to be as much reciprocation from the West as we had expected. They note this could prove disastrous as our diplomatic shift already alienates the socialist nations. We can only release a statement taking the Americans for their word and claim it was only a matter of timing. Hopefully the United States will soon realize its future relationship in South Asia has to involve India."
 USA_INDIA60s.3.d:0 "The military assessment team we invited has concluded their visit to India and proposed two options of support. They assessed our capabilities with regards to China and have offered equipment to help bolster the defensive capabilities of our troops. The equipment is frankly not that much and we feel this was done in order to minimize Pakistani anger and avoid domestic criticism of such a deal. However, such modern equipment can always be used. Alternatively, they have offered to support an expansion of special forces training and organization. This may prove very useful as our military is always looking to modernize its training and capabilities. We must decide which package to go with."
 USA_INDIA60s.4.d:0 "The Pakistani press and government have been voicing their displeasure over our recent military mission to India. The Pakistanis are calling us duplicity and they called our ambassador to express their disappointment with the developments. Although the Pakistanis are clearly infuriated, they are still quite dependent on us. We can expect this to boil over in time, but we will release a statement emphasizing our goal is peace for South Asia and we value our relationship with Pakistan. But all nations must understand we are free to conduct bilateral agreements with whomever we want."

 CPI_FP.3.d:0 "The Indian and Soviet leadership recently signed the Indo-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Cooperation. The agreement cements and announces the the strategic partnership between both nations. The United States and China are said to be greatly concerned by the agreement and it marks a clear shift away from nonalignment by India. Many Indian analysts welcome the move and view it as necessary due to Pakistan courting foreign aid. Following the signing of the treaty, the Soviet Union privately assured India it would soon send arms to bolster India as it faces threats on its border."
 burma_2022.2.d:0 "The residents of Rangoon woke to the sound of tanks, vehicles, and soldiers sweeping across the city. General Ne Win has assumed power. He soon addressed the nation in a brief radio address. General Ne Win called for calm, promising to end the ongoing economic and political instability in the country. He promised the establishment of a socialist republic with him serving as Prime Minister and chairman of a new governing Union Revolutionary Council. Reports on the ground indicate the former Prime Minister, Chief Justice, and leading politicians across all political parties have been detained by the Army. All universities are closed. The coup is being well-received both by the population and foreign embassies. Both perceived the previous government as being corrupt and incapable. The Army also enjoys popularity for its recent efforts at facilitating elections and promoting national unity."
 BCP.10.d:0 "The recent coup by the Burmese Army saw the detention of leading politicians and activists from Shan and Kayah. Many of the rebel groups in Burma believe the military intends to reignite conflict and assert its dominance across the country. As such, representatives from southern Burmese rebel groups signed an agreement promising to cooperate against military aggression. They also promised not to fight each other. The agreement is seen as a direct response to the new military government and a demonstration of rebel resolve to oppose a centralized Burmese state. The new Burmese government dismissed the news, stating it would not hinder its ability to bring national unity."
 India_Com60s.1.d:0 "With the communist electoral victory, the balance of power globally has shifted, and the global socialist camp grows even more powerful. The two leading socialist states, the Soviet Union and China welcomed the announcement and already sent high powered delegations to visit the CPI. Both have offered to exclusively aid our nation as it transitions into a revolutionary government. The Soviets bring a wealth of experience with regards to industrialization and advanced weaponry. However, the Chinese state more resembles our own with a large population and lack of industrial development, they may be better suited as an ally. Regardless, both indicated if we went with their guidance they expected an exclusive relationship, so we must now decide to accept Soviet or Chinese guidance."
 India_Com60s.2.d:0 "Perhaps the most important conference of the Indian Communist Party has convened. With the CPI in power, the moment has arrived to bring socialism and liberation to the workers and peasants of India. The major debate emerging is which style of socialism India must follow. One faction believes India should undergo a socialist transformation along the Soviet line, citing its importance as the first and most powerful socialist state. Others, especially rural activists believe India must follow the Chinese model. They note that China, like India possesses a largely agrarian, peasant population that was long oppressed by elites. The Chinese model is not hindered by the failure of Soviet theorists to predict the rise of socialism among the peasants. Representatives of both factions have addressed the conference and a vote will soon be held to determine which socialist path to embrace…"

 INC_1962.1.d:0 "The Defence establishment, particularly the armed forces prior to independence were closely connected with the colonial government and occupation of India. Many of the leading politicians of India had spent years battling a colonial regime backed with the support of these military forces. Many senior and mid-level officers were trained during the colonial period. As such, maintaining civilian oversight and obedience over the defence apparatus is a critical question. Recently, a senior advisor proposed the government experiment by handing the military more independence and control over military matters to increase the efficiency of the armed forces. This is an interesting proposal, but those opposed note giving such powers could court a potential coup in the future and that instead the Defence Ministry must be given even more oversight. We must decide on whether to temporarily increase civil oversight or give the military more control over purely military matters. Afterwards we can decide which path would be best for India."
 INC_1962.2.d:0 "We recently experimented on the question of what level of civil oversight to have over the military. Even after the recent changes, the government remains split on whether to support the loosening of civil oversight or encourage a stricter oversight. Those arguing for looser oversight note this would reduce slow decision making, increase efficiency, and bring confidence to uniformed personnel. Those who support strict civil oversight note this prevents military adventurism, keeps the country informed, and promotes a stable state. Any loss of efficiency to them is minor to the benefits gained by the nation and state institutions. We must make a decision on the future of civil-military relations in India."

 Mahalanobis.1.d:0 "The Mahalanobis Model guided our Second Five Year Plan. The model, developed by statistician Prasanta Chandra Mahalanobis is based on Marxist economic theory. It argues India must preserve a closed economy, raise capital through the industrial sector, and invest in expanding its production of capital goods as well as the consumption of goods sectors. The focus should be on capital goods production, in time, though initial growth will be slow, the economy will drastically expand along with the consumption of goods sector. Critics, however, point out the model does not take into account taxation, the role of global trade, and the ignoring of agriculture as a source of capital. More importantly, the Indian economy suffered weak growth during the Second Five Year Plan. The government must now decide whether it should continue the model or abandon it.

 INC_1967.1.d:0 "Since Partition the Indian military continues to make high demands for equipment, funding, and training. Recently, a newspaper published a report indicating a huge chunk of funding is being given as pensions to retired service personnel. Rapidly growing the military, raising the budget, and supporting an expansion will only lead to greater costs. A senior economic advisor proposed the government does not meet the defence requests for the near future. Although this would negatively impact military procurements and organization, the economic benefits will outweigh the depletion and once the economy booms, we can more easily meet defence demands. The Defence Minister vehemently opposes the measure noting India is in a hostile geographical neighborhood and must remain vigilant."

 Swatantra60s.1.d:0 "The liberalization policies of the current government radicalized extremist communist agitators in the countryside. They have been spreading propaganda across the nation and organizing violent peasant committees. These peasants raid landlords, seizing goods to sell, weapons, and uncultivated land. Rural police stations in certain areas are being overrun with their weapon depots cleaned out. The Indian Army proposed a plan to deploy paramilitary forces in hotspots to restore law and order and stop the agitation. Along with the military action, the Home Minister plans on sending officials to negotiate with villages and calm the peasants. The Prime Minister has signed off on the plan."
 Swatantra60s.2.d:0 "The military operations targeting peasant agitators is proving highly successful. Our forces recovered stolen cash and weapons. The professionalism of our forces ensured that there were minor combat operations, in most cases the peasant forces simply surrendered. The more hardcore communists resisted but they were easily overcome. The military continues to plan raids targeting the hardcore communists while government officials meet with villages to negotiate with peasants. The media constantly reports on villagers who renounce violence and pledge to work with the government. Regardless of these early successes, the operations continue."
 Swatantra60s.3.d:0 "The Indian government announced it will be greatly reducing military and outreach operations following its recent successes. In recent weeks, the military successfully neutralized many hardcore communist leaders, breaking the peasant resistance. The majority of the peasants agreed to renounce violence and return captured weapons. The media is widely reporting on the successful ability of the government to deal with the unrest with a minimum of violence. Analysts praise the strength of Indian institutions. The main concern however, is that many surviving hardcore communists have gone underground and will no doubt continue to try and spread agitation. For the moment however, the law and order situation has greatly improved in India."

 Swantantra67.1.d:0 "The Indian government sent a high-level delegation to visit the State Department and Pentagon. They have called for closer cooperation in defence and economic support. The current Indian government believes in liberalism and democracy. They wish to re-establish the historical connection between India and the West. Our own intelligence reports note the new government opposes the shift towards socialism and close ties to socialist states that the Indian state began after independence. We can offer an economic aid package, or an economic and defence package. However, getting closer to India would alienate Pakistan and if that is a concern for us, we should decline to sign any agreement. Indian elections are unpredictable and if the opposition returns to power, any gains we make with Indian ties could just as easily be reversed."
 Swantantra67.2.d:0 "Our efforts at forging closer ties with the United States bore fruit following an agreement on American aid for India. This is not traditional financial or material aid. Instead the United States will provide economic and political experts to strengthen the Indian economy and modernize administrative practices. Many in the media are praising our government for its successful negotiation and calling it a coup against Pakistan and their ties with the United States. The opposition is grumbling, and some leftist publications are calling it a return to colonialism, but overall the response has been largely positive."
 Swantantra67.3.d:0 "Our efforts at forging closer ties with the United States bore fruit following an agreement on American aid for India. This is not traditional financial or material aid. Instead the United States will provide economic and political experts to strengthen the Indian economy and modernize administrative practices. In addition to this economic support, the United States will also provide military advisors to improve our capabilities, technology, and production. Many in the media are praising our government for its successful negotiation and calling it a coup against Pakistan and their ties with the United States. The opposition is grumbling, and some leftist publications are calling it a return to colonialism, but overall the response has been largely positive."

 INDIA_COM_NEP.1.d:0 "The government received reports that the Nepali government was actively passing laws and targeting workers across Nepal. In particular, the Nepali government is accused of suppressing unions and the spread of socialist literature in the country. The Prime Minister held a cabinet meeting where it endorsed a parliamentary statement in support of Nepali workers. The Prime Minister next had to decide how to respond directly to the situation. One faction believes India should send a warning to the Nepali government to halt its crackdown on innocents. However, another faction argues the statement by parliament was enough and instead the government should direct the intelligence services to clandestinely support the workers in Nepal. Making too much a fuss could tip Nepal off and hinder our ability to send support across the border."
 INDIA_COM_NEP.2.d:0 "The Indian government, dominated by the communist party, send a warning through their ambassador for us to cease any crackdown or restrictions on the socialist workers of Nepal. This is in reference to recent protests over worker rights which saw some incidents of violence between police and protestors. We can certainly agree with the Indian demands, they are not overtly difficult, and we will remain vigilant to the communist threat. However, considering the aggressive Indian threat, there is always a risk of aggression, especially from our most important neighbor. The Foreign Minister stated he could reach out either to the United States or China. The United States would likely want to halt communist expansion by India. The Chinese, even if they have a similar government to India, are not expected to support Indian expansion that would allow it to put even more forces on the border with China."
 INDIA_COM_NEP.3.d:0 "The State Department gave the President an urgent request from Nepal. The Nepali government claims India is overtly commenting on its internal affairs and threatening military action should Nepal not comply. The situation reeks of communist expansionism and we would be completely justified to guarantee Nepali independence during this difficult period to quash Indian plans for expansion. Nepal is popular among Americans, including World War II veterans who fought alongside Nepali Gurkha soldiers during the war. Our analysts believe India will not likely act on its threats so guaranteeing Nepal would likely not be high risk. Some other advisors feel we should simply not get involved, Nepal is surrounded by hostile states and if India were to intervene, the United States would find itself unable to protect Nepal or restore democracy to the United States. Both sides make compelling arguments, but a decision must be made."
 INDIA_COM_NEP.4.d:0 "The Nepali government formally requested the help of China as it faces an unprecedented threat from India. Even if our viewpoint is similar to India, Nepal is a wonderful buffer and to lose it would expose China to Indian aggression if a hostile government takes over Delhi. China also believes in the sovereignty of all nations and India can be seen as engaging in expansionism. Perhaps it would be in the interest of China to offer a guarantee for Nepal. The other perspective notes that Nepal would likely be just as hostile as any future Indian regime and we have no obligation to prop up a corrupt regime. Perhaps it would be best for China to simply watch the developing situation play out and not risk socialist unity or our own resources on a foolish endeavor."
 INDIA_COM_NEP.5.d:0 "The Nepali government privately and publicly refused our request for basic human rights and decency for their own citizens. The media is incensed and there are large demonstrations being held across India in solidarity. The media is reporting on news of intense violence being perpetrated against not just Nepali workers but Indian migrants in the country. Our own government believes these reports are likely exaggerated, but now is not the time to quell the passion of the people. The military has asked if we wish for them to draw up plans for an intervention to end the reactionary government in Nepal. We must decide on this, but we should consider that Nepal likely reached out to one or two major powers to request support in this crisis. The other thing to consider is the potential losses and costs of a full-on intervention. We sent our warning and showed solidarity, the diplomatic and political benefits have already been gained as India asserts her place in the region. A decision must be made…"

 Sino_Indian_War_Redux.150.d:0 "The PLA successfully seized the narrow Silgurri Corridor, effectively isolating northeast India from the rest of the country. This offers a unique opportunity as we successfully have checkmated the Indian government. One option is to call a ceasefire, return the territories, this would reduce tensions and open a possibility of reconciliation in the future. The other option is to take the disputed borderlands and establish a Peoples Republic of India under Indian revolutionaries."
 Sino_Indian_War_Redux.151.d:0 "The Chinese government announced the establishment of the Peoples Republic of India in the occupied northeast Indian states. The new government will be headed by Charu Majumdar. The new government has called on all revolutionary Indians to come, with the promise of eventually spreading the revolution to India. The Indian government, joined by the United States, condemned what they call a Chinese client state. There are reports of unrest and protests in major Indian cities as many are stunned at the full-extent of the setback."

 SINO_INDIAN_WAR.150.d:0 "The Indian government launched a major diplomatic campaign, with its representatives addressing governments and media publications about the ongoing dispute with China. India claims Chinese soldiers continue to move forces south of the McMahon Line, violating international agreements. Indian diplomats noted its armed forces were currently deployed to counter this threat and prevent a forcible Chinese occupation. The Chinese government condemned the Indian claims, blaming the Indian Army of violating the border to forcibly evict its own forces."
 SINO_INDIAN_WAR.151.d:0 "Our military operations against China demonstrated the strengths but also the weaknesss of our capabilities. There are calls to refocus some of our resources. One group of civil and military officials believe the current intelligence mechanisms failed to provide adequate military intelligence, noting a lack of accurate maps. This group of officials would like to see more focus be placed on gathering military intelligence over other forms. Another group of civil and military officials noted the command mechanism at times gave civil officials, especially the Defence Minister, too much authority in military matters. These officials would like to see a reform at the top level. The government must decide whether to refocus our intelligence or reform the upper levels of military command."

"How has my once proud workers' nation betrayed me? Was I not destine to be fucking Lenin reincarnated with a dash of Mother Teresa that a cultured proletarian could honor for all time?"\n\nSablin looked up from his court booth at his once brave seamen, still standing erect with dignity in front of the fat and tyrannical Brezhnev. Today of all days, the Soviet premier looked especially bloated as he read Sablin his sentence.\n\nBrezhnev began to finger each page of Sablins charges while adjusting his glasses.\n"Please have mercy on the poor boy" Suslov said from the gallows in a raspy yet commanding voice.\nBrezhnev dismissed the objections of the old revolutionary and continued.\n\n"By order of the supreme soviet, I hereby sentence you to death by firing squad." Brezhnev said with a stoic grunt that made Sablin shudder with both fear and to his surprise excitement.\n\n"Could I be martyred? What if my death causes the soviet people to band around me in solidarity as they shout my name? Sablin… Sablin…. Sablin… they will chant. They will all remember me now!" He thought as an excited yet childish grin filed his blushing face.\n\nBefore he could finish his thoughts, two powerful soviet officers in trimmed khaki shorts grabbed him by his warm body and dragged him outside in front of the Lenin's tomb. The taller officer kicked sablin to the ground and put his boot on the disgraced revolutionaries' throat. Despite the thick rubber, Sablin could feel each tendon in the officers foot flex. The officer then bent over to his ear.\n\n"You lived like Lenin, and now you shall die like Lenin" the officer whispered before a crack echoed throughout the Kremlin walls. As the sound faded, the world had realized, they had lost the greatest revolutionary to ever live."

Naxalbari.1.d:0 "Revolutionary Charu Majumdar has completed a series of documents to guide the ideological principles and revolutionary tactics of militant communist Naxalites. The documents denounce the Soviet Union as revisionist, condemns the Indian state, and calls for a peoples war to overthrow the government. The Naxalites are members of a more radical, splinter group who left the mainstream Indian Communist Party. They felt the ICP was compromised for participating in national politics and engaging with an Indian state Naxalites view as a bourgeois institution. The writings are already spreading across rural areas, especially in Bengal. There are already reports of peasants in the Naxalbari block of the Darjeeling District in Bengal beginning to agitate. The Indian government fears these documents may encourage widespread unrest."
Naxalbari.2.d:0 "Peasant committees, inspired by the writing of Cahru Majumdar recently formed in Darjeeling district and started seizing land from landlords and cultivating It without authority. Some of the effected landlords established armed groups who are targeting sharecroppers suspected of involvement in these committees. Militant peasants are seizing arms, food, and cash from landlords. Over the past few days reports have reached Calcutta that armed peasants are storming local government and police outposts, seizing documents related to land ownership and firearms. Efforts by local authorities to organize police bands failed to dislodge the peasants. The West Bengal government is calling the law and order situation out of control and are requesting the deployment of paramilitary forces to the region."
Naxalbari.3.d:0 "The situation in Darjeeling district continue to deteriorate as efforts at deploying armed police failed to disperse the Naxalite peasant militants. However, the tide started to change once paramilitary forces arrived on the scene. These heavily armed, trained soldiers easily drove off and disarmed a number of militants in the initial phases. The Indian government informed the media the deployment and operations would continue until law and order is restored. A statement by the communist rebels accused the Indian government of atrocities and deploying paid mercenaries to massacre innocent peasants. Overall, the general public appears more interested in restoring law and order than in listening to the demands of the Naxalites."
Naxalbari.4.d:0 "Following the deployment of paramilitary forces, the Naxalite movement appears to have gone underground. Most peasant committees and armed bands have turned in their weapons, while the most radical members appear to have retreated deeper in the jungle or melted into the villages. The Indian government is praising the successful operation and note that several of the more radical communist militants have either been killed or captured during ongoing operations. The Indian public is largely supportive of the government action as many regard the Naxalites as radicals and view their public statements as propaganda. The Prime Minister and military are concerned that once the operations end the rebels may just return so are said to be exploring options to negotiate with the local peasant leaders."
Naxalbari.5.d:0 "Peasant leaders in Darjeeling district announced they would halt armed operations against the Indian state and no longer support the Naxalites. The government claimed once the peasants understood how they were being exploited by the Naxalites, they immediately apologized and pledged to no longer be led astray. The peasant representatives claimed they remained loyal citizens of India and appreciated the effort of the government to restore order and also listen to the grievances of the peasants. The Indian government for its part said it appreciated the support of the peasants and planned on halting paramilitary operations in the region. The government added it would seek to address the concerns of peasants to help restore peace in the region. With this announcement, it appears the government has ended the peasant unrest but there are still concerns over the Naxalite leaders who did manage to escape underground in recent days."
Naxalbari.6.d:0 "The Naxalites have been a thorn on the side of the government for several years. The Prime Minister, taking advantage of the emergency situation, recently directed the Army to coordinate with local law enforcement for an all-out offensive against the group. Once the requisite forces were organized, Operation Steeplechase commenced. Indian troops, including paratroopers, paramilitary units, and police swept through Naxalite-controlled territory. Hundreds of Naxalites were neutralized and at least 20,000 suspected members are in custody. The operation is a resounding success, but the government is keeping details of it secret from the public to prevent public anxiety. The media is being informed not to report on the operation or face prosecution for compromising national security."
Naxalbari.7.d:0 "Charu Majumdar, a founder of the Naxalite movement and leading ideologue for the movement passed away while in custody in in Calcutta. Prison authorities claim he died of a massive heart attack. The police accompanied the body to the crematorium where the family met them. The police prevented the family from viewing the body before overseeing the cremation. The family and critics of the government claim Majumdar was likely killed under torture and are condemning the government for political murder. Majumdar published many notable works but will be remembered for his Eight Documents, which lay the ideological foundation of the Naxalite movement. The Naxalites released a statement promising to continue the struggle and seek justice for their leader."

SINO_INDIAN_WAR.0.d:0 "The border disputes between India and China have escalated in the years since 1947. India has accused China of encroaching on its territory in the North East Frontier Area (NEFA) and stealing Indian land by occupying in Aksai Chin. The Chinese in contrast claim all those territories are historically Chinese. They also accuse India of interfering in Nepal and Sikkim to preserve their own claims and interests. These tensions recently escalated after the Chinese government published a new map confirming its Aksai Chin occupation and claiming all of NEFA as its own. The Indian Prime Minister called an immediate meeting to determine how India will react to this threat. Some are calling for a diplomatic effort, and if that fails, a military deployment. Others are advocating for an immediate military deployment to demonstrate Indian resolve in the face of Chinese provocation."
SINO_INDIAN_WAR.1.d:0 "The Indian Army reported that Chinese patrols have crossed the McMahon Line and setup outposts in strategic areas in NEFA. The recent publishing of controversial maps combined with these incursions are causing intelligence officials to conclude China maybe planning to seize NEFA from us. The Indian media is condemning the government and calling for a much tougher line on China. Our forces are monitoring the Chinese and it appears they are holding at the moment. We should decide quickly how to confront the Chinese provocation, whether through diplomatic or military means."
SINO_INDIAN_WAR.2.d:0 "The Indian government has issued loud and public denunciation of our recent maps, accusing us of occupying Indian land and claiming their territory. The Indian claims run counter to the historical facts and are based on British imperialist propaganda. We believe the Indians are either trying to save face with their public or are harboring dangerous ambitions against China. We recently received an invitation to hold formal talks regarding the disputed borders with India. Although we are just in our claims, it may prove fruitful to hear out the Indians and understand their ambitions. Senior officials argue we should attend the talks. Others in the government argue we should just decline to show India we will not be bullied."
SINO_INDIAN_WAR.3.d:0 "Senior Chinese leaders met with their Indian counterparts to hold talks over their disputed borders. The talks came following a diplomatic escalation caused by the publication of maps by the Chinese government that India claims placed its territory under Chinese rule. In particular the Indian government believes China is encroaching past boundaries negotiated by China and the British Indian colonial government and in the case of Aksai Chin, considered part of Jammu and Kashmir by India, they have simply seized Indian land. China in contrast claims it is occupying historically Chinese territory and India does not have exclusive claims to Aksai Chin due to the disputed nature of Kashmir. Analysts are unsure if India can achieve its goals as China is largely firmly in control of the disputed territories."
SINO_INDIAN_WAR.4.d:0 "India has started off our discussions on border disputes by calling for a Chinese withdrawal from Aksai Chin. The Indians claim the territory is historically a part of Jammu and Kashmir and since the Princely ruler acceded the state to India, that land belongs to them. Our own diplomats noted India had no presence in that territory, either in terms of personnel or citizens, and it was our government which established roads to link the area to China. Furthermore, Kashmir is a territory of international dispute and India does not have exclusive claims. We have no intention of giving up Aksai Chin, it is far too important for us strategically and we have invested heavily there. However, we will offer India a deal, they must accept our claim to Aksai Chin, and we will withdraw our own claims to the territory they call the North East Frontier Area."
SINO_INDIAN_WAR.5.d:0 "The Chinese government has offered an agreement to end their claims to the North East Frontier Area (NEFA) in exchange for us recognizing their occupation of Aksai Chin. The proposal essentially calls for the current borders to be made permanent and end the dispute. China definitely ends up winning the most though having an established border could reduce the security pressure on India. However, senior advisors warn the agreement will be seen as a defeat for India and we should make a counteroffer. After deliberation it was decided that we will ask China to also confirm its recognition of the borders of Nepal, Bhutan, and Sikkim. Furthermore, China must acknowledge India as the patron power of Sikkim. If China agrees to this, then a deal can certainly be reached. We can also reject this clearly biased solution from the Chinese and recognize they were never serious about negotiations."
SINO_INDIAN_WAR.6.d:0 "The Indian government has sent a counteroffer to us. For them to accept our claims to Aksai Chin and make the current border at NEFA permanent, they need us to confirm the current borders of Bhutan, Sikkim, and Nepal. Furthermore, they want us to recognize Sikkim as a part of the Indian sphere of influence. Accepting this would greatly hinder future diplomatic flexibility in the Himalayas but at least our claims would no longer face criticisms from India. If that is important to us, we must accept the agreement. If not, we can end the talks. We already control Aksai Chin and much of our claims to NEFA so a failure to sign an agreement would not be a disaster for our government."
SINO_INDIAN_WAR.7.d:0 "Despite widespread skepticism from experts, the leaders of China and India signed a comprehensive agreement to resolve their border dispute. In the final agreement, India must accept Chinese control of Aksai Chin and their current boundary in the disputed NEFA border area. In exchange the Chinese must also accept the current boundary in NEFA and end its claims to the whole territory from India. Furthermore, China has agreed to accept the current borders of Sikkim, Nepal, and Bhutan, using boundaries established by the former British colonial government of India. The agreement appears to be a true compromise. Chinese control of Aksai Chin is legitimized while India has firmly established its influence among the Himalayan states."
SINO_INDIAN_WAR.8.d:0 "Hopes that India could negotiate a resolution to their border disputes with China have ended in failure. The Chinese government is being accused by Indian officials and newspapers of harboring hostile territorial designs on India. One particularly scathing editorial noted the Chinese had seized Indian lands since 1947 and when India sought to hold talks to peacefully try and end this aggression, the Chinese proved uncooperative and satisfied with their theft. There are growing calls for the government to take a much stronger approach by deploying troops on the border. In China, the response was largely muted, with senior officials and state media stating that China has no imperialist ambitions and will not be bullied to handing over historically Chinese territory by India. In at least one report a senior Chinese official pointed out that India should be thankful China does not forcibly evict them from the Chinese territory they continue to occupy."
SINO_INDIAN_WAR.9.d:0 "Following reports that the Chinese were slowly deploying troops in NEFA, a high-level meeting was called by the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister heard from senior defence officials and military leaders about plans to implement the Forward Policy strategy against Chinese infiltrators. Forward Policy calls for Indian troops to establish posts behind Chinese forces to cut them off from their supplies and force their withdrawal. General B.M. Kaul, a leading advocate for the strategy insists Forward Policy is defensive and will result in Chinese withdrawals, with little risk of casualties. He assessed the Chinese military as being largely of militia quality. Some senior generals voiced concerns over escalating the conflict and leaving Indian forces isolated in forward posts, but in the end the Prime Minister approved the plan for implementing Forward Policy in NEFA."
SINO_INDIAN_WAR.10.d:0 "The Forward Policy has so far led to success along the McMahon Line. Most of the Chinese incursions have withdrawn back across the line. The Indian Army is ecstatic with the results and they now proposed a plan to establish posts north of the McMahon Line and solidify our claims to the area. Many officers believe the operations prove the hypothesis that Chinese forces lack modern military standards. However, some of the other senior generals are urging caution, stating we have stabilized the borders and should not press an experienced Chinese military. The Prime Minister must decide whether he wants to move forward to finally end the threat of Chinese incursions."
SINO_INDIAN_WAR.11.d:0 "The Indian Army has established a series of posts in our territory north of the McMahon Line. The Indians had claimed the McMahon Line marked our border but this incursion clearly shows they have hostile intentions. Our own forces are worried that from these posts the Indians will soon interdict the movement of reinforcements and supplies. However, these posts are largely isolated and if we move adequate forces, they can use infiltration tactics to drive the Indians back. The decision is ours, should we drive off the Indians or let them push us back and make a new defensive line."
SINO_INDIAN_WAR.12.d:0 "The Indian government announced its forces had asserted its position in NEFA and had neutralized the Chinese threat to its territory. The Indian Army in its own statement praised the professionalism of its forces in carrying out difficult operations. The Chinese government has not released any public statements, but its diplomats are said to be criticizing India for its hostile action. It appears the Chinese government were not willing to fight for this territory. A Chinese delegation was said to have flown to Delhi for emergency talks."
SINO_INDIAN_WAR.13.d:0 "A Chinese delegation arrived in Delhi to hold emergency talks with the Prime Minister over the recent violence along the border in NEFA. The Chinese are asking for us to withdraw to the pre-war McMahon Line border. They promised if we accept, they will ensure their forces no longer carry out incursions and respect the line. They suggested a refusal may cause China to act. The proposal appears reasonable as we have long called for the McMahon Line to be accepted as the border. However, we currently have the advantage and it may be foolish to let it go."
SINO_INDIAN_WAR.14.d:0 "The Indian government has shown their imperialistic ambitions by refusing to restore the borders. Despite our call for restoring peace, the Indians instead are now occupying Chinese lands they claimed to have no interest in previously. The PLA is ready for action and is ready to move in if ordered. We must decide if we want to launch an offensive to evict the Indians or if we should just let the situation remain. The people of China are feeling humiliated, perhaps now is the time to act and restore order."
SINO_INDIAN_WAR.15.d:0 "The Indian government was stunned to receive news of Chinese troops attacking Indian outposts all along our positions in NEFA. The Chinese government claimed the PLA is moving in to restore order and stability in the area. The Indian Army, although surprised, promises their forces are more than capable to meet the threat. The Chinese government also stated its operations were meant to teach India a lesson on humility. The Indian government in contrast has condemned the Chinese action, calling it a continuation of its hostile actions since independence."
SINO_INDIAN_WAR.16.d:0 "The Indians and Chinese are currently embroiled in an armed conflict. Many in the GHQ believe this presents an opportunity for Pakistan to make gains in Kashmir. The conflict has caught our intelligence and military off-guard, many of our forces are currently on leave. However, if we give the order now, we can try to push from Haji Pir and Burzil and seize territory north of Srinagar. This advance will immensely improve our position in Kashmir but not provoke the Indians or international community to the point of overt condemnation. However, if the attack fails we may take unforeseen losses. We must make the decision to deploy the military or not."
SINO_INDIAN_WAR.17.d:0 "The Indian military reported to the Prime Minister that Indian forces had launched a limited offensive in Kashmir. Early intelligence and reconnaissance reports indicate this is not the beginning of a full-on invasion but appears to be an opportunistic attempt to make border gains while we are fighting China. We are already reaching out to the major powers to protest this Pakistani aggression, but it appears they will not likely do much considering its limited scope. Regardless, our forces will respond and punish the Pakistanis for this treachery. However, we must be sure that we do not forget the Chinese threat. The people must rally to the nation."
SINO_INDIAN_WAR.18.d:0 "The fighting in Kashmir died down in recent hours. Recent reports indicate a new ceasefire is in place and it appears Pakistan now occupies strategic territory north of Srinagar. Jubilant crowds are said to be gathering in major cities across Pakistan following an announcement by the government that some Kashmiri lands had been liberated. The Indian government has tried to remain quiet so far, however, it is clear from private statements that a setback had occurred in Kashmir. Analysts note Pakistan likely improved its position along the border, but it is not likely that they seized huge amounts of lands as that would have provoked a general war and international condemnation. Many Indian newspapers are condemning Pakistan for backstabbing them as they fight the massive communist Chinese invasion."
SINO_INDIAN_WAR.19.d:0 "The recent Pakistani offensive against Indian forces in northern Kashmir ended in failure. Pakistan had hoped to take advantage of the Sino-Indian conflict by making gains in Kashmir. Pakistan hoped to establish a new position that would enable it to better liberate Kashmir in the future. Instead, the Pakistani offensive not only failed but saw Indian forces advance and capture the strategic Burzil Pass. With Burzil Pass under Indian control, they are now in a position to threaten Skardu. The Pakistan government conceded an unprovoked Indian offensive had made minor gains but Pakistani forces prevented further losses. Analysts believes the Pakistani military may have rushed into battle hoping to achieve surprise but this ended up backfiring for them. There are reports of angry Pakistani crowds assembling, while the Indian media is full of praise for the armed forces."
SINO_INDIAN_WAR.20.d:0 "The Indian government declared its forces had cleared invading Chinese troops and established a new line north of the McMahon Line. India argues it acted only after years of Chinese provocations. The Chinese government was quick to condemn India for its aggression against the Chinese people and claimed their forces had simply been caught off guard and not defeated in combat. The Indian Army is said to be ecstatic with its recent performance in not just repelling the Chinese assault but also pushing them back. While the Chinese government is underplaying the extent of the fighting, privately many analysts believes Beijing will likely conduct an extensive evaluation of its military forces. India must decide if it wants to permanently occupy the land it has gained, risking a general war with China, return the land for security guarantees, or press its advantage and advance deeper into Chinese territory."
SINO_INDIAN_WAR.21.d:0 "Following our recent clashes with an aggressive and cunningly prepared Indian military, they occupied lands beyond what they originally claimed. They are calling it the natural frontier of their territory called the North East Frontier Agency (NEFA). Intelligence reports Indian troops are digging in and establishing permanent construction sites. We must decide how to act, either we accept the Indian gains and re-establish a ceasefire line, or we expand the conflict and start a general war to drive the Indians out of these lands." 
SINO_INDIAN_WAR.22.d:0 "The Indian government dispatched a senior diplomat to privately deliver a message. If we would accept the pre-conflict McMahon Line as the permanent border and publicly withdraw our claims to lands south of the so-called McMahon Line. The proposal appeared reasonable and our government accepted, though a further demand we withdraw from Aksai Chin was rejected. Over the next few days the Indian Army withdrew its forces as our troops returned to the area. Our commanders are under strict instructions to obey the established pre-conflict line as the Indians made it clear a failure to do so could result in a fresh attack. The Indians are gloating over their success while we must figure out what went wrong."
SINO_INDIAN_WAR.23.d:0 "The Indian Prime Minister lauded the people of India and the armed forces for their steadfast bravery in the face of massive Chinese aggression on the border. Painting a dire picture, the Prime Minister noted the Chinese were only miles from reaching the plains of India and ravaging the nation before the Indian military defeated them. The remarks came following reports that India successfully repulsed a Chinese offensive along their disputed border in the North East Frontier Agency. The Chinese government downplayed the recent setbacks, accusing India of being the aggressor and grossly exaggerating the extent of the fighting. The Chinese media is portraying the fighting as a minor skirmish, but analysts believe the truth lies between the two stories being portrayed."
SINO_INDIAN_WAR.24.d:0 "The PLA has successfully driven the Indian troops occupying our lands back and have even pushed deep into NEFA. Some reports are calling the Indian defeat disastrous and claim China has basically completely occupied NEFA. These reports are not that far off, our forces will soon control NEFA and are poised to inflict a devastating blow to India proper. However, doing so may provoke an international intervention and our commanders are not sure if we have the logistical capacity to invade such a large nation. We can either press on and open up the conflict, claim NEFA and risk India expanding the conflict, or simply announce a ceasefire and return to what we see as the pre-war borders to maximize the psychological, diplomatic, and military success of our forces."
SINO_INDIAN_WAR.25.d:0 "Sikkim has long been a puppet to the Indian government. Its people are controlled by a puppet prince placed there by British imperialists and maintained by the Indian successor state. The territory offers India a ledge to spy on us and its status as a "independent" state makes it a perfect buffer for them. With our conflict in India heating up, it may be in our interests to no longer accept the myth of Sikkim and its artificial borders. The PLA is ready to move in and liberate its people from local tyranny and Indian hegemony. However, the choice on what to do with Sikkim ultimately lies with the Chairman and Politburo."
SINO_INDIAN_WAR.26.d:0 "Following our reversals in the recent border conflict with China, we have lost the North East Frontier Agency. The Chinese attacked with overwhelming and lethal power, catching our forces off guard to seize the lands. Intelligence reports indicate the Chinese are currently digging in the territory and are moving materials to establish permanent structures to solidify their claims. The Indian military admits it was it took a hit in the recent conflict, but if called upon it will strike back. We can order the military to escalate the conflict and launch an all-out attack to drive back the invaders, or we can leave the situation as is and let this fighting come to an end."
SINO_INDIAN_WAR.27.d:0 "The Chinese government announced a ceasefire and have withdrawn its forces to the pre-conflict border with India along the so-called McMahon Line. This news has stunned the Indian government which had recently begun a desperate call for help to deal with what it termed to be Chinese aggression. The Chinese government insisted its forces acted defensively and as China was not an imperial power, it had no desire to invade or occupy any other nation. Analysts suggest the Chinese actions mark a diplomatic and military victory. By not seizing lands, China undermined the Indian argument that it faced a massive invasion from China. In addition by publicly showing it was their forces who were withdrawing under no threat from India, it highlights the thoroughness of their military successes in the conflict. Already the Indian media is publishing critical articles and sources indicate the Indian government plans on doing a lot of soul searching."
SINO_INDIAN_WAR.28.d:0 "The recent conflict between India and China alongside their disputed border in the North East Frontier Agency ended in a Chinese military victory. The Indian military proved incapable of the task and are being seen as poorly equipped and led during the conflict. Many Indians believe this failure to supply and lead highly motivated and trained soldiers is a result of complacency and lingering colonial influences on the institution. For China, the military victory is seen as confirmation that the PLA is capable of not only waging massive wars but also handle localized threats to its borders. Many now suggest the fighting in India offers a blueprint that can be used in other difficult border areas. Chinese leaders are thrilled by the successful coordination of diplomatic, military, and political power to achieve success."
SINO_INDIAN_WAR.29.d:0 "The Indian government has sent out a desperate plea, calling for extensive military aid to strengthen the Indian military as it faces the threat of communist China. Intelligence reports warn a communist advance in India could provoke the Indian communists to abandon the government and break Indian unity. They suggest we should provide military aid, especially for mountain warfare units to help bolster their defenses and help them prevent a deep communist penetration. Although it appears natural we should aid India against a communist foe, some in the administration warn the Indian government has historically been cold to the West. In addition, providing such aid would provoke an angry response from Pakistan. We must decide how to act."
SINO_INDIAN_WAR.30.d:0 "Emergency equipment of western arms have arrived to aid the Indian Army in its defence against China. Although our government requested a much larger aid package and called for western bombers to target the Chinese, this support will improve our capabilities. The Defence Ministry will oversee the integration of such equipment to our forces and we have sent a message of gratitude to the United States. Pakistan is furious over the decision, but this is no matter, India needs this support to defend itself. Indian communist activists are also condemning this action, but we informed the public our acceptance of such aid does not indicate we have joined the Western camp."
SINO_INDIAN_WAR.31.d:0 "With the conflict between India and China escalating into a full-on war, there may be an opportunity for us. We can mobilize our forces and attack India as they are no doubt distracted by this conflict. Many advocate that a strong strike can secure Kashmir and perhaps resolve some of the lingering territorial issues from Partition. There are already some in the country calling for the government to act in this golden opportunity. However, others in the government are urging caution. They fear if we join the war we may become internationally isolated and lose key UN support for Kashmir."
SINO_INDIAN_WAR.32.d:0 "The American Ambassador called on the President for a private discussion. The ambassador gave a dire warning that the United States was aware of our plans to join the war against India. He added if such an action was taken the United States would halt all military and economic aid. It would also pressure its allies to cut off its own support, which would essentially cripple our economy and severely weaken the military. The United States cannot tolerate one of its regional allies joining a communist nation in a war of aggression. After giving this warning, the President called an emergency cabinet meeting. After a brief discussion, it was decided that current plans to join the war will be shelved."
SINO_INDIAN_WAR.33.d:0 "In a rare act of cooperation, the United States and Soviet Union have both brought intense pressure, either indirectly or directly to China and India. They are pressuring the two sides to quickly end the current fighting and return peace to the region. So far both governments are resisting the superpower pressure. However, there is wider international concern regarding the potential humanitarian or wider geopolitical consequence of the war if it lasts too long. Privately, the leaders of China and India are informing their commanders that they must achieve results as soon as possible."
SINO_INDIAN_WAR.34.d:0 "The United Nations announced a ceasefire between China and India has come into effect. The recent conflict escalated following a series of border clashes along the McMahon Line in the eastern Himalayas. This border conflict escalated into a general war, but the international community quickly put heavy pressure for the fighting to end. There was fear regarding the humanitarian costs of having the two largest populations engaged in an all-out war with one another. The coming days will the final results from the conflict."
SINO_INDIAN_WAR.35.d:0 "Following a UN ceasefire, it is clear that India has dominated the former McMahon Line. Chinese troops have largely been driven out and the Indian government claims it will maintain control in order to protect the North East Frontier Area from future Chinese aggression. The Chinese government released a brief statement condemning Indian militarism and imperialist ambitions. Beijing had long claimed the territory, including all of NEFA as its own, but following this setback, it must contend with Indian control of the area."
SINO_INDIAN_WAR.36.d:0 "India had vehemently condemned the Chinese occupation of Aksai Chin when it discovered China built highways connecting the region to China. India argued the land was historically part of Kashmir and thus under Indian control. China disagreed, claiming the land as historically Chinese and noting that Kashmir was disputed, negating any Indian claims of complete authority. During the cent conflict, the Indian military managed to successfully dislodge Chinese forces and occupy Aksai Chin for the first time in Indian history. With the ceasefire in effect, the Indian government announced it had liberated Kashmiri land and removed one of the foreign occupiers of the former princely state. It added that complete liberation would be a matter of time. This last statement angered Pakistani leaders who issued a protest statement. Observers note with its victory in Aksai Chin, Pakistan is now more diplomatically isolated with regards to Kashmir and China has lost a key connection between its main lands and Xinjiang."
SINO_INDIAN_WAR.37.d:0 "In a major setback for China, the victorious Indian government announced the establishment of a new provisional government of Tibet following a UN ceasefire which ended their recent conflict. The new government in Lhasa is to facilitate the return of an independent Tibetan state. The successful advance of Indian forces pushed the Chinese to the point that their presence in Tibet appears increasingly untenable. Many Western states were quick to praise this decision and the Dalai Lama is said to be preparing for his return to Lhasa. The Chinese government is condemning the installing of a puppet regime and privately there is a fear that Tibet may become lost permanently. In Lhasa, there are reports of civilians celebrating as Indian troops look on, providing security for the festive atmosphere."
SINO_INDIAN_WAR.38.d:0 "Following the ending of fighting between China and India following a UN brokered ceasefire, the Chinese announced it was in full possession of its rightful claims along its eastern border. The Indian government has remained mute, but privately some officials have admitted the Chinese are in full control of not just the McMahon Line but also all of the North East Frontier Agency. The lack of Indian reaction and the immense international pressure which brought a ceasefire indicates India will likely have to accept the territorial setback."
SINO_INDIAN_WAR.39.d:0 "The end of fighting between India and China saw Chinese forces overrun much of Indian Kashmir. The Chinese are being met as liberators by some Kashmiris, with Chinese troops being greeted by homemade Kashmiri, Pakistani, and Chinese flags. This has recently led to embarrassing propaganda photos and incidents of Pakistani officers acting as "observers" visiting Kashmiri leaders. The Chinese government upped the ante by declaring they will soon withdraw from Kashmir but under the condition that India enforces UN resolutions on Kashmir and hold a plebiscite. The alternative is China continuing to occupy Kashmir or, more likely, hand the territory over to Pakistan. The Indian government is expected to soon announce its intention to hold plebiscite, which will trigger a Chinese withdrawal and a new future for Kashmir."
SINO_INDIAN_WAR.40.d:0 "During the recent conflict between India and China, the PLA managed to capture Sikkim. The Chinese portrayed the conquest as a liberation from a corrupt, Indian-backed puppet regime. The Indian government called it a naked land grab and called on the people of Sikkim to stay strong during their difficult time. Regardless, the Chinese remain firmly in control of Sikkim and the Chinese are already announcing plans to integrate the former princely state along the lines of what the government did in Tibet. The former royal family of Sikkim has fled to Delhi and are holding press conferences with Indian and global media."
SINO_INDIAN_WAR.41.d:0 "The Chinese government formally handed power to a new independent Kashmiri government in Srinagar. The Chinese claimed the Kashmiri people for years remained under the autocratic rule of a British-backed monarch, only to then be the victims of Indian and Pakistani imperialism. The new Kashmiri government released its own statement claiming for the first time since 1947, all of Kashmir was under one government. It added that for the first time in its history, the province would be under the control of the Kashmiri people. This is the latest blow to Pakistan and India following their military defeat against China. The new Kashmiri state provides China a strategic buffer and greatly weaken the geopolitical positioning of the defeated states. India and Pakistan both released statements expressing their disappointment to these developments."

CMC_Sino_India_War.260.d:0 "The Chinese government capitulated to international pressure to halt its war against India. An international coalition, including the United States and Soviet Union recently formed in response to an escalating Chinese invasion of India. The powerful anti-Chinese coalition is called for China to halt its war and restore Indian territory. The Indian government welcomed the news, calling it a victory for peace and its steadfast support for international cooperation. The Chinese are said to be bitter with the news. Leading publications are calling the coalition a neo-imperialist plot meant to hold China back."

India_Pak_War_65.1.d:0 "We will soon approach the UN to arrange a ceasefire to end the current war against Pakistan. Our senior officials and military leaders suggest continuing the conflict will not greatly change the current situation on the ground. Our people and military have fought with immense bravery and discipline. The Pakistani aggression has been met by our strongest resistance and we cannot expect more. It is now our duty to bring the conflict to a conclusion and end the fighting."
India_Pak_War_65.2.d:0 "Our armed forces gave a befitting reply to the recent aggression by Pakistan. The result of their folly is clear for the world to see. However, a never-ending conflict and arms race in South Asia is not the destiny our founders envisioned for the Indian Union. Now that we have the upper hand, it is a moment for us to reach out and offer brotherly ties with Pakistan. This would also allow us to confirm the new political order in South Asia. Internationally, such an approach will be widely appreciated."
India_Pak_War_65.3.d:0 "The Indian government formally requested talks with our government. The Indians claim they wish to reset relations and end the years of animosity since Partition. It is likely the Indians want to normalize relations and establish stronger trade ties. Some of our advisors feel this may help out our economy which is reeling from the recent war and losses. In addition, this could build support among the liberal elements of society. However, India is likely capitalizing on their recent military success and to engage them may be seen as acknowledging our weak position. It may be better for the morale of our people to reject this initiative and focus on our efforts to rebuild. We must decide how to respond."
India_Pak_War_65.4.d:0 "During our talks with India, they have proposed a complete normalization of relations along with an agreement to ease immigration restrictions. The agreement would improve relations, especially trade ties. Our own population would likely support the easing of immigration, this would allow the reunion of families and friends long separated by Partition and offer opportunity for some citizens to reclaim lost properties. However, there is some resistance, especially among senior military officers who believe the best approach would be to walk away from the talks and end the talks. This would assert Pakistani defiance. We must decide how to respond."
India_Pak_War_65.5.d:0 "Our recent effort to normalize relations with Pakistan has ended in success. The Pakistanis agreed to sign a range of agreements which will improve trade, normalize relations, and ease immigration restrictions. News of the agreement is already being positively received domestically and internationally. The world now sees India is a new type of power. Indians and Pakistanis can now become like the brothers and sisters they were meant to be. We are not a militarist power or imperialistic, instead we are a peace-loving nation devoted to continuous peace."
India_Pak_War_65.6.d:0 "The Indian effort at normalizing ties with Pakistan ended in embarrassing failure. The Pakistanis condemned the Indians for seeking to cement their recent successes and turn Pakistan into an Indian puppet. The Pakistan government released a further statement claiming they will never give up on their desire to liberate the people of Kashmir and prevent India from becoming a hegemonic power in South Asia. The Indian government responded by saying Pakistan was politicizing a genuine effort at peace and they had only revealed their desire for war."
India_Pak_War_65.7.d:0 "The military setbacks in our recent war with Pakistan has revealed systemic problems. Parliament, shortly after the conflict ended, established a commission to study these military deficiencies and develop solutions. Their conclusions have been submitted to the Prime Minister who must decide on which recommendation to implement. The Prime Minister must thread carefully as too drastic of an action could break the institutional health of the military. The committee ultimately blamed the backwards colonial heritage inherited from the British. This has led to a recruitment policy which excludes large parts of the population. In addition, this has caused a number of senior officers who reached their ranks largely due to their service in the colonial British Indian Army. One solution is to institute reforms in recruiting, which would allow us to more effectively use our immense manpower. The other solution is to sack a number of Army officers and pave the way for more creative, professional officers to rise. We must decide what reform is most important as doing both could prove catastrophic."
India_Pak_War_65.8.d:0 "After releasing the committee report on recent military failures, the Prime Minister decided to act. He has announced the sacking of a large number of senior officers, especially Brigadiers, Major Generals, Lt Generals, and Generals. This will pave the way for younger officers to rise. The military response has been mute, but privately many officers are said to be fuming. Regardless, the public is largely supportive of the actions, viewing it as a necessary action. This is no doubt an incredibly difficult day for India, but without these actions, India cannot have the rebirth necessary to overcome its recent setbacks."
India_Pak_War_65.9.d:0 "The Indian government announced a series of reforms meant to widen the base of recruitment and better connect the military to the people of India. The government added it is following recommendations recently made by the parliamentary committee investigating recent military failures. Many Indians strongly support the decision as many felt the military continues to cling onto colonial practices with regards to its recruiting and organization. The new reforms will expand the base of recruitment and establish more training programs to civilian education institutions. The Indian government added these reforms will help the nation maximize its vast population and resources to better ensure the defence and honor of India."

Jammue_Refugee_Crisis.1.d:0 "The Pakistan insistence of seizing Kashmir has seen the largest refugee crisis since partition. Hindu Kashmiris are streaming into Punjab. There are reports that emboldened Kashmiri Muslims are forcibly seizing properties and threatening the Hindu community. The refugees are being placed in temporary camps before they can be rehabilitated. The arrival of refugees is raising anger and communal spirits. The local authorities are deploying extra police to prevent violence. Their presence is also renewing criticism of the government for its performance in the war."
IND_BAN.22.d:0 "Our failed offensive in East Pakistan has provoked open revolt and rioting by Bengali refugees and their supporters in Calcutta. The reaction is driven by genuine despair and the pressures caused by the massive influx in refugees since the crisis began. The local authorities requested support from local Army units to keep the peace. Many shops and buildings were damaged in the violence, with local reports calling it the worst violence since Partition. There are now calls from residents for the government to deport the refugees. We will have to deal with tensions in Bengal for the foreseeable future."

IND_BENGAL.1.d:0 "The Pakistan Army recently launched a crackdown in East Pakistan. Their brutal violence has escalated the situation and resulted in a growing refugee crisis. Pakistanis, especially Hindus, are fleeing to Calcutta from East Pakistan. They are bringing stories of atrocities and brutal repression. The international media is covering the situation while local authorities are setting up emergency refugee camps. Reports from the border suggest the number of refugees will likely reach the millions. The federal government will step in to help local authorities. Considering the number of refugees and the resources we will require to host them we can expect the economy to be negatively impacted. There are also fears that tensions will rise between our population and the refugees. Regardless, the people of India must rise to the occasion and help the Bengalis suffering under military repression."
IND_BENGAL.2.d:0 "The Indian government formally requested we act to help resolve the situation in East Pakistan. The Indians are pointing to the rising refugee crisis in Calcutta and the widely reported news of a brutal Pakistani military crackdown. The Indians suggest if a solution cannot be found, they may be forced to act and resolve the situation themselves. We have historically close ties with Pakistan and the State Department suggests we can put pressure on them. Our national media is widely reporting on the Pakistani crackdown and there is growing agitation for us to act and end the violence. However, the Pakistanis would likely view any effort by us negatively and it is generally not our policy to not intervene in the internal affairs of friendly states at the behest of other states."
IND_BENGAL.3.d:0 "The United States recently dispatched a diplomatic delegation to Pakistan and urged its government to halt its ongoing military operations in East Pakistan. The Pakistani government publicly stated it appreciated American interest but privately reports indicate they are furious. The American effort is not likely to cause Pakistan to change its approach to the situation, but it indicates the rising international isolation Pakistan is facing with its ongoing operations. The Indian government released a statement in support of the American effort, fueling media reports in Pakistan accusing America and India colluding against the nation."
IND_BENGAL.4.d:0 "The Indian government recently dispatched an emergency delegation to hold talks with us over the ongoing crisis in East Pakistan. The Indians expressed fears that if the situation deteriorated further it could lead to catastrophe across the region. They urged us to implement the Ahsan Formula as the best solution to end the crisis in a peaceful and honorable way. This was done privately as the Indians did not want to make it seem like they were forcing our hand and to give us political cover, which is appreciated. Senior military leaders and hawks are urging the President to reject what they see is Indian hegemony. However, some cabinet members believe the Ahsan Formula remains the best solution and we should implement it as soon as possible."
IND_BENGAL.5.d:0 "We received a troubling ultimatum from the Indian government calling for us to immediately halt military operations and withdraw from so-called Bangladesh. The Indians call the operations a humanitarian crisis and incubator of human rights abuses that will boil over and lead to catastrophe across the region. They are giving us three months to implement the withdrawal, stating that a failure to do so may result in India taking whatever actions are necessary to end the violence. There are many who feel India is just blustering and have no intention of involving themselves militarily. Some other leaders believe even if India intervenes, the Pakistan nation is more than ready to offer a befitting reply. Privately, a few officials are urging the President to accept the ultimatum and cut our losses in East Pakistan. They say the sting of a withdrawal is much preferred to what they fear may end up being a military disaster."

INDIA_KAS60s.0.d:0 "Several days ago, Srinagar erupted in mass protests following reports that a Holy Relic was stolen from the famed Hazratbal Shrine. Kashmiri Muslims immediately took to the streets to condemn the theft and the protests soon evolved into anti-Indian agitation. Communal tensions in Kashmir are heating up as rumors that the Hindu community organized the theft spread among Kashmiri Muslims. The Indian government was caught off guard by these protests and are scrambling how to respond. Local authorities are concerned and want to deploy police with troops to quell the unrest. However, members of the cabinet and central government feel such a strong-armed approach may enflame tensions. Instead they suggest the government call for a complete investigation and express understanding to the unrest."
INDIA_KAS60s.1.d:0 "Several weeks after the Indian government announced it was deploying its top investigative unit, the Central Bureau of Investigation, to find the stolen relic in Kashmir, it was recovered yesterday. The Indian and Kashmiri government have not explained how the relic was recovered, but expressed satisfaction. Hindu temples and Masjids held prayers of thanks to help reduce the communal tensions in the region. Many Kashmiris, especially those connected with the government are satisfied with the results, but there is lingering animosity towards the Indian government over its failure to end the political limbo Kashmir remains in. Among more anti-Indian Kashmiris, they are spreading rumors that the relic recovered was a forgery created by the government."
INDIA_KAS60s.2.d:0 "In response to the theft of a Muslim holy relic in Srinagar, Kashmiri Muslims began agitating in frustration to the theft but also continued Indian rule over the Kashmir Valley. Many are expressing anger over the political limbo Kashmiris have lived under since 1947. Communal tensions also rose as rumors of Hindu involvement with the theft and their perceived closeness to the Indian government. In response to the unrest, the Indian government deployed troops along with armed police. This heavy-handed approach ended up enflaming tensions as Muslims noticed troops deployed to protect Hindu temples, enflaming the communal and political unrest. The holy relic was recovered yesterday, but hopes that this would immediately end the protests were dashed as Kashmiris in Srinagar continue to agitate against their current political impasse."
INDIA_KAS60s.3.d:0 "Over the past several months, Indian soldiers and police have detained agitators across Kashmir. These men were identified by the government as being ringleaders involved in sowing discontent and communal tensions in the province. Although the number of protests had decreased following the recovery of the stolen holy relic, this latest wave of arrest has sparked a new round of demonstrations. Many Kashmiri political leaders are now criticizing the Indian government for using force instead of dialogue during a period of heightened tensions. The media across India is widely supporting this tough line to what the government has portrayed as general lawlessness."
INDIA_KAS60s.4.d:0 "Following the recent tensions in Kashmir, the Indian government realized the Kashmiri people were increasingly frustrated over the current situation. As part of efforts to rectify this, the Indian government announced it would release famed Kashmiri political leader Sheikh Abdullah. The former Prime Minister of Jammu and Kashmir had been serving a long-term prison sentence for allegedly plotting against India to establish an independent Kashmir state. Upon his release Sheikh Abdullah pledged he would work with the Indian government and ensure the rights and wishes of the Kashmiri people are always satisfied. This action will help alleviate some of the frustrations among Kashmiris who welcome the return of a man called the Sher-e-Kashmir (Lion of Kashmir)."
INDIA_KAS60s.5.d:0 "The recent religious and political upheaval has caused major communal disturbances in East Pakistan and West Bengal. In East Pakistan, demonstrators condemned what they perceived was an attack on Islam and the continued repression of Kashmiri Muslims by the Indian state. These demonstrations turned into communal riots when protestors began attacking Hindu neighborhoods. When people in West Bengal heard of these attacks, they started their own demonstrations and targeted Muslim neighborhoods, causing riots to breakout. The scale of the violence is nowhere near the communal riots of Partition, however, many in India fear further incidents could escalate the situation. Bengal is currently calm, but the communal tensions between Hindus and Muslims is heightened."
INDIA_KAS60s.6.d:0 "The Parliament is debating whether to invoke Articles 356 and 357 to Jammu and Kashmir. This would suspend the state government and allow the center to impose direct rule over the province, allowing it to assume legislative authority. Imposing State Rule will enable the government to amend the state constitution in Kashmir and gut some of the autonomy granted through Article 370 and make the state more inline with the Indian Constitution. Considering the recent unrest in Kashmir, many in India believe this action is essential to preventing either a Kashmiri or Pakistani plot to undermine Indian rule. Many of the leading Kashmiri politicians, even pro-Indian ones are arguing vehemently against this action and argue such a move would be seen as a betrayal by Kashmiris and cement their animosity to India."
INDIA_KAS60s.7.d:0 "The Indian parliament voted to invoke direct rule on Kashmir by using Articles 356 and 357 of the constitution. The decision is being seen as an essential action to ensure Kashmiri loyalty and continued integration to India. The government claims direct rule will enable the center to ensure Kashmir operates as a productive state that can bring progress and development to the people of Kashmir. Kashmiri political leaders widely condemned the action, arguing India had betrayed its promise in 1949 to preserve Kashmiri autonomy. Although there is resentment among Kashmiris, so far there are not reports of mass protests or unrest."
INDIA_KAS60s.8.d:0 "The Indian Parliament has passed a series of legislation and amendments to the Kashmiri state economy which has largely undermined the Article 370 guarantees regarding internal autonomy. The post of Prime Minister has been abolished, only to be replaced with the titles of Governor and Chief Minister to ensure Kashmir is consistent with other Indian states. The Indian government has rejected criticism from many Kashmiri political leaders and Pakistan that it is going back on its promises. Instead the Indian government claims without these reforms, Kashmiris will miss out on developmental funds and democratic reforms enjoyed by other Indian states. Some Kashmiri leaders are supporting the efforts, leading to divisions within the Jammu and Kashmir National Conference. The Indian government insists its actions are for domestic improvement and does not undermine its commitments to Kashmiris or the international community."
INDIA_KAS60s.9.d:0 "The Jammu and Kashmir National Conference, the legal political party advocating for the preservation of Kashmiri autonomy, recently voted to dissolve itself. This is the first step of a plan to merge the party as a branch of the Indian National Congress. The National Conference believes only through working with the central government and a national party can they ensure the continued preservation of Kashmiri autonomy within India. They argue the lack of such contacts led to the recent imposition of state rule. However, the action has caused a rival faction to split from the National Conference. This group, led by supporters of Sheikh Abdullah have formed a group called the Plebiscite Front. The Plebiscite Front advocates for the implementation of the UN sponsored Plebiscite to determine the future of Kashmir. The division of Kashmiri "

Sino_India_Pact.1.d:0 "India has requested we honor our defense pact and join them against China. The recent border conflict between the two has escalated into a general conflict. Considering our own dispute with India, there are some officials who believe we should offer aid only with a guarantee that the UN resolutions on Kashmir be implemented after the conflict. Other officials believe the Chinese aggression is a regional threat and we should honor the treaty. Finally, there are those in the government who believe we should simply deny we are obligated to help and let India bleed out. A decision is needed."
Sino_India_Pact.2.d:0 "According to the terms of our mutual defense treaty, we recently called on Pakistan to join us in the face of a massive Chinese invasion. The Pakistanis claim though they sympathize with our situation, the people of Pakistan remain passionate over the plight of Kashmiris. They insist we must agree to implementing the UN resolutions on Kashmir after the conflict. Doing so would resolve any animosity and enable Pakistan to completely come to our side. Considering the military situation, a number of officials are interested in accepting the terms believing it offers short term and long term benefits. However, a number of officials are opposed, seeing it as a surrender to Pakistani aggression, they believe we should go it alone."
Sino_India_Pact.3.d:0 "The Pakistan government announced it would be honoring its defence pact with India and join the fight against Chinese aggression.  Both governments also confirmed an agreement was reached with regards to Kashmir, reflecting this new spirit of unity in South Asia. Both nations will implement existing UN resolutions to resolve the status of Kashmir after the conflict with China is resolved. Pakistani troops are said to be rapidly mobilizing. The Chinese government condemned the agreement, calling it shameless jingoism."
Sino_India_Pact.4.d:0 "Pakistan and India could not agree on terms for Pakistan joining the war against China on the side of India. Neither government has revealed what went wrong, though there are rumors that continued tensions over the final status of Kashmir prevented an agreement. The Pakistan media claims the government is not obligated to intervene as it is not clear who started the Indo-Sino conflict. Indian newspapers claim Pakistan renegade the defence pact and sought to blackmail the Indian government. Regardless of the true cause, it is clear Pakistan will not intervene to support India."
Sino_India_Pact.5.d:0 "The Pakistan government, following talks with senior Indian officials, confirmed it would honor the defence pact and join the fight against China. The Pakistani leadership noted this crisis is not a time for politics or squabble, the people of the subcontinent must work together to prevent a new foreign power seeking to dominate. The Pakistan Army is said to be rapidly mobilizing. The Indian government welcomed the news. There are reports of protests from Kashmiri communities in Pakistani cities and members of religious parties condemning the decision. They believe Pakistan has betrayed the Kashmiri cause by not demanding its resolution in exchange for support."

Pak_India_War_65.1.d:0 "The Pakistan Army recently launched Operation Nusrat. Pakistani forces along the Kashmir ceasefire lines are conducting reconnaissance operations to find gaps and infiltration points along the border. Small incursions are also being launched to test response times and local civilian reaction to our movements. The knowledge we are gaining will be crucial in potential operations in Kashmir. It appears the Indians are not aware of the full extent of our operations. Our troops are highly motivated and confident, these operations are raising morale and experience."
Pak_India_War_65.2.d:0 "After a series of high-level meetings involving senior officials from the cabinet and military, it was decided to reactivate Operation Gibraltar, a plan originally conceived in the early 1950s. The plan calls for the infiltration of Pakistani troops disguised as freedom fighters. These men would then conduct sabotage operations and encourage a popular uprising to end Indian rule in Kashmir. All of the soldiers involved are to be recruited from the Azad Kashmir Regiment. The plan is to conduct a month of specialized training before sending them over the border. Nine infiltration forces have been designated, each named after a famous figure from Islamic history."
Pak_India_War_65.3.d:0 "Columns of the infiltration forces crossed the border in Kashmir. They began moving to their planned areas of operations. However, the infiltration did not go as smoothly as we hoped. Some groups were discovered by locals who informed Indian authorities. They assumed our armed men, dressed as civilians, were armed criminals and not freedom fighters. Other forces are moving far slower to their areas of operations. Despite these setbacks, we have already received reports of some sabotage operations and armed clashes with Indian forces. Intercepted communications indicate the Indian Army believes an armed uprising maybe occurring. Ideally the locals will soon come to this conclusion as well and join in an uprising. Once the uprising begins in earnest our forces will advance to complete the liberation."
Pak_India_War_65.4.d:0 "Operation Gibraltar has not advanced the way we had hoped. Many locals have either stayed away from our fighters or have led Indian forces to their camps. Most of our infiltration groups have taken heavy losses, with some even retreating to the border. At this point the Indian Army clearly realizes they are facing our troops and not insurgents. There have been heavy fire fights and some sabotage operations but not to the extent we hoped. We may need to consider escalating to phase two with a direct attack along the border by our forces to save the situation and not lose momentum."
Pak_India_War_65.5.d:0 "Our infiltration bands successfully crossed into occupied Kashmir. Since arriving, they have successfully targeted key Indian military and infrastructure sites. Our fighters are successfully sowing chaos in Kashmir, with emboldened Kashmiri activists launching protests in Srinagar. As our operations continue, the Indian government will be forced to engage with us or risk the complete isolation of the Indian Army in Kashmir. While the GHQ is celebrating the success, believing Kashmir will fall soon, there are some officials raising concerns. They argue the Indians may instead seek to escalate the situation, especially since by now they recognize just how involved the Pakistan Army is in spearheading the unrest."
Pak_India_War_65.6.d:0 "Over the past few weeks our forces in Kashmir have engaged in heavy fighting against numerous groups of armed fighters. At first our local intelligence feared this was the beginning of an armed rebellion among the Kashmiris. However, it is now clear from the reports from locals and captured fighters that these are Pakistani regulars. We have two options in front of us, we can launch border offensives to punish the Pakistanis and take the fight to them. If we break through, we could improve our position along the ceasefire line and maybe even push for a resolution in Kashmir. The other option is to simply continue our operations to root out the infiltrators and restore normalcy in Kashmir as soon as possible."
Pak_India_War_65.7.d:0 "Over the past few weeks, our forces in Kashmir have engaged in heavy fighting against numerous groups of armed fighters. At first our local intelligence feared this was the beginning of an armed rebellion among the Kashmiris. However, it is now clear from the reports from locals and captured fighters that these are Pakistani regulars. These infiltrators have caused extensive damage to the local infrastructure and we have troubling reports of some local Kashmiris joining the fighters. With the situation deteriorating we are left with two options. We can launch offensives along the ceasefire line to punish the Pakistanis and relieve pressure. The other option is to announce our support for implementing UN resolution 47 and hold a plebiscite."
Pak_India_War_65.8.d:0 "In response to Operation Grand Slam the Indian Army has launched offensives along the Kashmir ceasefire line. Our forces were caught off guard in certain sectors but are tenaciously resisting. With the grace of Allah, we will soon repulse this attack. Our commanders on the ground are confident that in time we will soon take the fight to the Indians and complete our mission to finally liberate Kashmir from its occupation."
Pak_India_War_65.9.d:0 "The Indian offensive along the ceasefire line has largely been repulsed by the Pakistan Army. Although the Indian forces appeared to make some initial gains, localized Pakistani counterattacks held firm. In particular, Indian forces appeared close to capturing the Haji Pir pass but were halted. Observers are watching the situation closely to see if Pakistan will launch its own offensive in response or work to cool down the escalating situation. This recent round of fighting was brought about after India discovered Pakistani troops were infiltrating into their controlled part of Kashmir to launch attacks. Both the United States and Soviet Union released statements calling for calm in the region."
Pak_India_War_65.10.d:0 "The Indian offensive along the ceasefire line in Kashmir is making dangerous gains against Pakistani forces. The Indian Army recently announced its forces were now firmly in control of the Haji Pir pass. This revelation marks a major setback for Pakistani forces and threatens Muzaffarabad. It appears these offensives are limited in nature and not an all-out assault on Pakistani controlled Kashmir. The Indian government reiterated that Pakistan must withdraw all its infiltration forces from Indian Kashmir and that the recent military action was a direct response to Pakistani aggression. The Pakistan government has remained largely quiet. There are fears of further escalation in Kashmir despite calls from the United States and Soviet Union for a restoration of peace."
Pak_India_War_65.11.d:0 "With Indian pressure mounting on the ceasefire line and in occupied Kashmir, the senior Pakistan Army commanders have planned Operation Grand Slam. This offensive will relieve pressure on our troops already committed to action and if it succeeds, we could potentially cut off India from occupied Kashmir. The thrust of the offensive will be directed to Akhnoor. If we seize the city, Kashmir will be cut off and our we can finally complete the liberation of Kashmir. The troops are positioned, and we just need to approve the operation to get it underway."
Pak_India_War_65.12.d:0 "Operation Grand Slam is making tremendous gains. Our forces are rapidly moving towards Akhnoor and once it is secured, we will be able to cutoff the Indian Army and even take Jammu. Reports from our officers on the front praise the effectiveness and morale of our soldiers. They believe once India is cut off, they will have to evacuate the Kashmir Valley or risk losing all its forces in Kashmir. The Air Force and Navy have gone on high alert, especially along the international border. However, latest intelligence reports indicate India will not likely escalate the conflict beyond Kashmir."
Pak_India_War_65.13.d:0 "Operation Grand Slam has largely stalled. Our initial attack, especially the artillery, performed magnificently. However, our forces encountered difficult terrain and a much more tenacious defensive force than was expected. Although it is clear we are not threatening to cut India off from Kashmir, the offensive has succeeded in relieving pressure on our other forces and stabilizing the ceasefire line. Our men will fight on and hopefully a new opportunity will emerge. However, what is clear is that the situation in Kashmir is spiraling out of our hands rapidly."
Pak_India_War_65.14.d:0 "The massive Pakistani offensive towards Akhnoor caught our forces completely off guard. However, despite their superiority in numbers and equipment, our men are fighting bravely. The local commander says his forces can certainly hold the Pakistanis for several more days, however, he fears the size of the attacking force and does not feel he has enough reserves. The situation has left us with two options. One is to declare our intention to implement UN resolution 47 on Kashmir and commit to the process. Although difficult, we may end up losing Kashmir but not on the battlefield. We can certainly find a moment to punish the Pakistanis later. The other option, by far the most popular one, is to expand the conflict and attack West Pakistan from the international border. This will relieve pressure and we can quickly seize the city of Lahore to use as a bargaining chip. The only other alternative is a military disaster in Kashmir."
Pak_India_War_65.15.d:0 "The recent Pakistani operations in Kashmir, from infiltrating guerrilla fighters and then launching a large offensive to cut off Indian forces has succeeded in securing the Kashmir Valley. When Pakistani forces finally cut off India from Kashmir, the Indian government came to an agreement. They would cede the Kashmir Valley, including Srinagar, to Pakistan and establish a new ceasefire line. In exchange, Pakistan guaranteed the swift evacuation and return of Indian forces along the old ceasefire line. Soon after the agreement, Pakistani troops reached Srinagar, where their supporters came out to support them. However, the celebrations occurred amid a background of not just Indian forces withdrawing but also minority families wishing to remain a part of India. The Indian government claimed it had no choice but are facing scathing criticisms from the opposition in parliament."
Pak_India_War_65.16.d:0 "The Indian Armed Forces have thwarted the machinations of Pakistan and its military. Its efforts to spark an uprising and then seize Kashmir through armed force has been halted. Our forces possess the momentum. We can certainly halt the fighting here, leave the borders as is and hope Pakistan learns its lesson. However, many civilian and military leaders are now insisting we force a decisive resolution to ensure Pakistan never again considers such plans. They propose we expand the war across the international border in West Pakistan. If we quickly seize the important city of Lahore and press on in Kashmir, we can finally assert are status as the undisputed power in the region."
Pak_India_War_65.17.d:0 "The recent armed conflict in Kashmir has escalated into a full-blown war between India and Pakistan. Indian forces have reportedly crossed the border near Lahore and are rumored to be moving in other sectors. The Pakistani government released a defiant message to its population calling on its people to band together against the Indian invasion. The Indian government stated its operations were in response to the unprovoked violence unleased by Pakistan in Kashmir. They stated the Indian military would not rest until the Pakistani threat was neutralized."
Pak_India_War_65.18.d:0 "With war breaking out in West Pakistan, the command in East Pakistan must decide whether to active the theatre or not. The front with India is long and our forces present in East Pakistan are normally small. It may be better to keep our forces in their alert positions. If we do not show them aggressive intent, the Indians may choose to not make this front active as well. However, some officers believe we have adequate forces to not just hold our own to tie down Indian divisions but even launch offensive operations. We must decide what stance to take."
Pak_India_War_65.19.d:0 "With war breaking out in Kashmir and along the West Pakistan border, our Eastern Command must consider its options. We can try to keep our forces in an alert position, but not with hostile intent. If the Pakistani forces reciprocate to this, we can keep the front quiet. This will ensure we can commit the maximum forces to the main front. Not engaging East Pakistan would also show our support to the Bengalis of Pakistan which may help us in the future. Some of our senior officers however believe we possess adequate forces to push deep into East Pakistan. They are pushing for us to open up this front and immediately prepare for operations."
Pak_India_War_65.20.d:0 "Although India and Pakistan are engaging in open warfare in the west, both militaries have tacitly decided to not activate fighting along the East Pakistan border. Although the Indians and Pakistanis may be tempted to shift forces out of the area, as long as the war is raging, there is always the possibility that fighting can open up there. Many Bengalis in East Pakistan are not aware of this situation and there is a feeling of apprehension that they may be overwhelmed and left unprotected from a major Indian operation."
Pak_India_War_65.21.d:0 "The war between Pakistan and India escalated as fighting broke out between the two sides on the border with East Pakistan. Citizens in Calcutta and Dahka are reported to be stocking up on supplies. Blackout practices that have not been done since World War II are being brought back. Although both sides are promising a swift victory, it is currently uncertain who will have the upper hand in this area of battle. Volunteers on both sides are flocking to provide aid for their respective nation."
Pak_India_War_65.22.d:0 "The situation in South Asia has escalated into an all-out war between India and Pakistan. Our diplomats and agents on the ground blame this fighting on Pakistan. This fighting is the result of recent Pakistani operations in Kashmir meant to force a resolution to the conflict. The State Department and intelligence community are livid. They believe Pakistan is using arms we provided to launch their operations and this conflict will only end up strengthening communism in the region. They are suggesting we announce an arms embargo on both India and Pakistan. Pakistan will be far more impacted by this. Some military experts however are urging caution and say we should not make such a rash decision. Pakistan is still a vital state for us."
Pak_India_War_65.23.d:0 "The United States ambassador has informed us his government will soon announce a freeze of all military aid and shipments to Pakistan and India. They claim this is to prevent a further arms buildup in the region. The American ambassador also added the American government had always insisted its arms be used for the defense against communism and our use of American arms against India violated those terms. This is of course a big blow and preposterous. Our nation faces an invasion from a much larger neighbor, and we are entitled to use whatever weapons we have for the defense of the homeland. America has clearly shown their true colors."
Pak_India_War_65.24.d:0 "The ambassador of the United States informed our government there will be a freeze to all potential military aid or arms shipments to India and Pakistan. They claim this is to prevent a further arms buildup in the region. This news is no doubt a blow to Pakistan who have long been dependent on American arms. Our own military insists this news will not have a major impact. We responded to the ambassador by informing him it was the actions of his nation which emboldened the Pakistanis to act this way. Without American support, Pakistan would not have sought to upset the current situation."
Pak_India_War_65.25.d:0 "As the fighting with India intensifies, the Pakistanis are demanding an immediate resupply of arms, tanks, and aircraft for their forces. They state the stress of open war is causing much wear on their equipment and they desperately need the support. The Pakistani military notes that India is cozy with Moscow and if Pakistan fails, Soviet influence in the region will be unchecked. The State Department finds the claims dubious but note American aid will certainly cement relations between us and Pakistan. Other senior officials suggest it would be better if we decline to involve ourselves in the conflict."
Pak_India_War_65.26.d:0 "The United States has completed an emergency supply of arms to our forces. This equipment will go a long way in helping us out during this current struggle. The Indians were not happy about the rapid arrival of arms. Although we had asked the Americans for a much larger shipment of arms, considering the short notice, the military is very satisfied. The American action clearly shows they are true friends of Pakistan, and their action will not be forgotten anytime soon. The equipment is being quickly sent to frontline units."
Pak_India_War_65.27.d:0 "With the war reaching a critical level, the senior leadership of Pakistan made an emergency visit to us in order to gather support. We informed them that if they are worried of defeat, they should prepare for a peoples war and outlast their enemy. The Pakistanis politely took our advice but stated at the moment they needed our direct involvement. Our own experts suggest directly involving ourselves would not be a prudent. Instead we can offer either arms or vehemently condemn Indian aggression during this conflict."
Pak_India_War_65.28.d:0 "Although China could not promise us an armed intervention during our current war with India. They have ensured an emergency shipment of arms reach our forces. Our military desperately needs all the support it can get. With this aid, China no doubt has shown itself to be a great friend of Pakistan. The equipment is quickly being processed and made ready for immediate use on the front. The war with India continues but with help like this, we hope to end it in a decisive victory for the people of Pakistan."
Pak_India_War_65.29.d:0 "The Chinese released a troubling statement yesterday. They accused our government of naked aggression and imperialist designs on Pakistan. They insisted Pakistan was the victim of unlawful aggression and stated they were monitoring the situation closely. We have received reports of Chinese troop movements along the border. The implication appears to be that if we continue the conflict, China may choose to intervene against us. This is important to consider. However, several advisors dismissed the statement as bravado and insist China would not actually intervene. They argue China is just trying to show Pakistan its support without actually committing forces."
Pak_India_War_65.30.d:0 "The war with India has reached a critical level. Our top commanders and officials indicate the time is right to seek an end to the fighting. We will soon direct the relevant officials to approach the United Nations. We will ask them to facilitate a ceasefire with India and deploy observers to ensure the peace. We hope the Indians will quickly comply and this fighting can be halted as soon as possible. Regardless of the results, the people and armed forces of Pakistan have performed admirably."
Pak_India_War_65.31.d:0 "The United Nations approached our government saying Pakistan was ready to declare an immediate ceasefire. The news is hardly surprising given the situation on the ground. The United Nations added in their communication that a ceasefire is the desire of the global community. We are meeting with our top military and government officials to assess the situation on the ground. Clearly the Pakistanis want an end to the fighting and we can agree to that. However, our diplomats said they could delay the ceasefire for a maximum of ten days before international pressure becomes too much. If we feel another ten days of fighting could benefit our final position, we can also do that."
Pak_India_War_65.32.d:0 "The United Nations approached our government saying India was ready to declare a ceasefire. This news is not surprising given the situation on the ground. The United Nations added in their communication that a ceasefire is the desire of the global community. We are meeting with our top brass and officials to assess the situation. We can certainly agree to the ceasefire now, which India is advocating at this stage. However, the Foreign Ministry believes we can use delaying tactics and delay a ceasefire for up to ten days before international pressure becomes too much. If we feel another ten days of fighting could improve our final position, we can also do that."
Pak_India_War_65.33.d:0 "A United Nations sponsored ceasefire has finally come into effect, at least temporarily halting the current Indo-Pakistan conflict. Both sides appear to be adhering to the ceasefire. The United Nations released a statement claiming with the fighting stopped, observers will soon arrive to help ensure there are no major ceasefire violations or territorial grabs by the two sides. The leaders of India and Pakistan are also expected to meet soon and seek to formally end the conflict. Many across South Asia can finally breathe a sigh of relief as this latest round of extensive fighting appears to be over."

# -On to Srinagar! (India gets Akhnoor Threatened, Pakistan should gain the territory west of Jammu in the map, threatening Jammu and cutting off easy access for Indian troops into Kashmir. Pakistan also should lose focus "Operation Nusrat". So maybe the map should be adjusted with an opening into Kashmir from the Pakistan bank of the Chenab River. Essentially, in the new map, I would like to see the region south of Poonch and west of Jammu, that is along the Pakistan border ceded to Pakistan, and their should be an opening from the Pakistan province bordering it that has a river bank with the Chenab river)

# 1965 Indo-Pakistan War (India/Pakistan)
# "The recent armed conflict in Kashmir has escalated into a full-blown war between India and Pakistan. Indian forces have reportedly crossed the border near Lahore and are rumored to be moving in other sectors. The Pakistani government released a defiant message to its population calling on its people to band together against the Indian invasion. The Indian government stated its operations were in response to the unprovoked violence unleased by Pakistan in Kashmir. They stated the Indian military would not rest until the Pakistani threat was neutralized."
# -So it begins (India and Pakistan are at war, should immediately fire East Pakistan Theatre? event for Pakistan and Eastern Front? event for India. US should immediately get "Place Arms Embargo" event)
# East Pakistan Theatre? (Pakistan Event)
# "With war breaking out in West Pakistan, the command in East Pakistan must decide whether to active the theatre or not. The front with India is long and our forces present in East Pakistan are normally small. It may be better to keep our forces in their alert positions. If we do not show them aggressive intent, the Indians may choose to not make this front active as well. However, some officers believe we have adequate forces to not just hold our own to tie down Indian divisions but even launch offensive operations. We must decide what stance to take."
# -Keep the front quiet (if India also selects this, then the event ���East Pakistan Front Quiet")
# -Move to battle positions (Eastern front open, will lead to event, "East Pakistan Front Opens"
# Eastern Front? (Indian Event, received once war breaks out)
# "With war breaking out in Kashmir and along the West Pakistan border, our Eastern Command must consider its options. We can try to keep our forces in an alert position, but not with hostile intent. If the Pakistani forces reciprocate to this, we can keep the front quiet. This will ensure we can commit the maximum forces to the main front. Not engaging East Pakistan would also show our support to the Bengalis of Pakistan which may help us in the future. Some of our senior officers however believe we possess adequate forces to push deep into East Pakistan. They are pushing for us to open up this front and immediately prepare for operations."
# -Keep the front quiet (if Pakistan also selects this, then the event "East Pakistan Front Quiet" is launched
# -Move to battle positions (Eastern front open, will lead to event, "East Pakistan Front Opens")
# East Pakistan Front Quiet (Pakistan/India)
# "Although India and Pakistan are engaging in open warfare in the west, both militaries have tacitly decided to not activate fighting along the East Pakistan border. Although the Indians and Pakistanis may be tempted to shift forces out of the area, as long as the war is raging, there is always the possibility that fighting can open up there. Many Bengalis in East Pakistan are not aware of this situation and there is a feeling of apprehension that they may be overwhelmed and left unprotected from a major Indian operation."
# -All quiet on the eastern front (both Pakistan and India get a decision to activate the front, if selected, than East Pakistan Front Opens event fires. All the provinces along the East Pakistan border should be made into demilitarized areas to prevent fighting)
# East Pakistan Front Opens
# "The war between Pakistan and India escalated as fighting broke out between the two sides on the border with East Pakistan. Citizens in Calcutta and Dahka are reported to be stocking up on supplies. Blackout practices that have not been done since World War II are being brought back. Although both sides are promising a swift victory, it is currently uncertain who will have the upper hand in this area of battle. Volunteers on both sides are flocking to provide aid for their respective nation."
# -Front opens (if demilitarized, those areas are now open, Pakistan gets spirit for three years, "Bengali Patriotism" which should give a small manpower and large stability boost for Pakistan)
# Place Arms Embargo? (US Event)
# "The situation in South Asia has escalated into an all-out war between India and Pakistan. Our diplomats and agents on the ground blame this fighting on Pakistan. This fighting is the result of recent Pakistani operations in Kashmir meant to force a resolution to the conflict. The State Department and intelligence community are livid. They believe Pakistan is using arms we provided to launch their operations and this conflict will only end up strengthening communism in the region. They are suggesting we announce an arms embargo on both India and Pakistan. Pakistan will be far more impacted by this. Some military experts however are urging caution and say we should not make such a rash decision. Pakistan is still a vital state for us."
# -Impose Embargo (Pakistan gets event, "US Freezes Military Shipments", Pakistan focus "Demand American Resupply" is no longer available, India gets event "American Arms Freeze")
# -We will let it play out (no change)
# US Freezes Military Shipment (Pakistan event)
# "The United States ambassador has informed us his government will soon announce a freeze of all military aid and shipments to Pakistan and India. They claim this is to prevent a further arms buildup in the region. The American ambassador also added the American government had always insisted its arms be used for the defense against communism and our use of American arms against India violated those terms. This is of course a big blow and preposterous. Our nation faces an invasion from a much larger neighbor, and we are entitled to use whatever weapons we have for the defense of the homeland. America has clearly shown their true colors."
# -Big blow (Pakistan-US relations take a big hit, Pakistan gets spirit "US Arms Embargo" idk what effects this would have but this should ensure Pakistan no longer has access to Western Arms market
# American Arms Freeze (Indian event)
# "The ambassador of the United States informed our government there will be a freeze to all potential military aid or arms shipments to India and Pakistan. They claim this is to prevent a further arms buildup in the region. This news is no doubt a blow to Pakistan who have long been dependent on American arms. Our own military insists this news will not have a major impact. We responded to the ambassador by informing him it was the actions of his nation which emboldened the Pakistanis to act this way. Without American support, Pakistan would not have sought to upset the current situation."
# -So what (India-US relations take a hit, India gets spirit "US Arms Embargo" idk what effects this would have but this should ensure Pakistan no longer has access to Western Arms market)
# Pakistan Demands Resupply (US Event from Pakistan focus)
# "As the fighting with India intensifies, the Pakistanis are demanding an immediate resupply of arms, tanks, and aircraft for their forces. They state the stress of open war is causing much wear on their equipment and they desperately need the support. The Pakistani military notes that India is cozy with Moscow and if Pakistan fails, Soviet influence in the region will be unchecked. The State Department finds the claims dubious but note American aid will certainly cement relations between us and Pakistan. Other senior officials suggest it would be better if we decline to involve ourselves in the conflict."
# -Provide the arms (US-India relations hurt, leads to event in a week US supplies arrive)
# -Politely decline (US-Pakistan relations hurt)
# US Supplies Arrive (Pakistan)
# "The United States has completed an emergency supply of arms to our forces. This equipment will go a long way in helping us out during this current struggle. The Indians were not happy about the rapid arrival of arms. Although we had asked the Americans for a much larger shipment of arms, considering the short notice, the military is very satisfied. The American action clearly shows they are true friends of Pakistan, and their action will not be forgotten anytime soon. The equipment is being quickly sent to frontline units."
# -Thanks to Uncle Sam (Pakistan-US get a big relations boost, Pakistan gains 5000 small arms, 150 artillery, 75 mbts, and 50 Sabre jets)
# Pakistan Mission to China (China Event from Pakistan focus)
# "With the war reaching a critical level, the senior leadership of Pakistan made an emergency visit to us in order to gather support. We informed them that if they are worried of defeat, they should prepare for a peoples war and outlast their enemy. The Pakistanis politely took our advice but stated at the moment they needed our direct involvement. Our own experts suggest directly involving ourselves would not be a prudent. Instead we can offer either arms or vehemently condemn Indian aggression during this conflict."
# -Offer Pakistan arms (Pakistan gets event, Chinese Weapons Arrive five days later, two days later, India gets event, China Condemns Indian Aggression)
# -Condemn India (two days later, India gets event, China Condemns Indian Aggression)
# Chinese Weapons Arrive (Pakistan event)
# "Although China could not promise us an armed intervention during our current war with India. They have ensured an emergency shipment of arms reach our forces. Our military desperately needs all the support it can get. With this aid, China no doubt has shown itself to be a great friend of Pakistan. The equipment is quickly being processed and made ready for immediate use on the front. The war with India continues but with help like this, we hope to end it in a decisive victory for the people of Pakistan."
# -Thank the chairman (Pakistan-China ties big boost, Pakistan receives 3000 small arms, 100 artillery, 50 mbts, 30 multirole fighters)
# China Condemns Indian Aggression (Indian event)
# "The Chinese released a troubling statement yesterday. They accused our government of naked aggression and imperialist designs on Pakistan. They insisted Pakistan was the victim of unlawful aggression and stated they were monitoring the situation closely. We have received reports of Chinese troop movements along the border. The implication appears to be that if we continue the conflict, China may choose to intervene against us. This is important to consider. However, several advisors dismissed the statement as bravado and insist China would not actually intervene. They argue China is just trying to show Pakistan its support without actually committing forces."
# -China should mind its business (India-China relations take a big hit)
# Pakistan Approaches UN (Comes from Pakistan focus, Pakistan event)
# "The war with India has reached a critical level. Our top commanders and officials indicate the time is right to seek an end to the fighting. We will soon direct the relevant officials to approach the United Nations. We will ask them to facilitate a ceasefire with India and deploy observers to ensure the peace. We hope the Indians will quickly comply and this fighting can be halted as soon as possible. Regardless of the results, the people and armed forces of Pakistan have performed admirably."
# -approach the un (in a day or two, india gets "Accept UN Ceasefire")
# Accept UN Ceasefire? (India)
# "The United Nations approached our government saying Pakistan was ready to declare an immediate ceasefire. The news is hardly surprising given the situation on the ground. The United Nations added in their communication that a ceasefire is the desire of the global community. We are meeting with our top military and government officials to assess the situation on the ground. Clearly the Pakistanis want an end to the fighting and we can agree to that. However, our diplomats said they could delay the ceasefire for a maximum of ten days before international pressure becomes too much. If we feel another ten days of fighting could benefit our final position, we can also do that."
# -Ceasefire now (immediately, UN Ceasefire Comes Into Effect)
# -Delay Ceasefire (after ten days, UN Ceasefire Comes Into Effect)
# Accept UN Ceasefire? (Pakistan)
# "The United Nations approached our government saying India was ready to declare a ceasefire. This news is not surprising given the situation on the ground. The United Nations added in their communication that a ceasefire is the desire of the global community. We are meeting with our top brass and officials to assess the situation. We can certainly agree to the ceasefire now, which India is advocating at this stage. However, the Foreign Ministry believes we can use delaying tactics and delay a ceasefire for up to ten days before international pressure becomes too much. If we feel another ten days of fighting could improve our final position, we can also do that."
# -Ceasefire now (immediately, UN Ceasefire Comes Into Effect)
# -Delay Ceasefire (after ten days, UN Ceasefire Comes Into Effect)
# UN Ceasefire Comes Into Effect (Pakistan/India)
# "A United Nations sponsored ceasefire has finally come into effect, at least temporarily halting the current Indo-Pakistan conflict. Both sides appear to be adhering to the ceasefire. The United Nations released a statement claiming with the fighting stopped, observers will soon arrive to help ensure there are no major ceasefire violations or territorial grabs by the two sides. The leaders of India and Pakistan are also expected to meet soon and seek to formally end the conflict. Many across South Asia can finally breathe a sigh of relief as this latest round of extensive fighting appears to be over."
# -Indo-Pakistan Ceasefire (the war should end but Indian and Pakistani positions should remain as is to determine which end of war treaty route occurs and what the final territorial exchange is)
# End of 1965 War Chain
# Tashkent Declaration chain
# Conditions required for Treaty of Tashkent (if the conditions of the other end of war chains not met, that this is the chain)
# Pakistan Post-War Assessment (Pakistan event)
# "The Soviet Union has graciously offered to host peace talks in Tashkent to help end our war with India. As we prepare for the conference, we must consider what occurred during the recent conflict. Although our forces did not achieve decisive results, the Pakistan military held it own against a much larger enemy, no doubt impressing the world. During the conflict, both us and the Indians gained and lost territory during the fighting. The Foreign Ministry suggests we press India to implement the UN resolutions during the peace talks. They must surely recognize this is the only way to prevent future conflict with us. Our top diplomats, however, suggest the Indians will not likely accept this and the most basic result we can hope for is a return to pre-war borders. Considering how our war propaganda talked of great victories, event that result may lead to great disappointment."
# -Preparing for Tashkent
# India Post-War Assessment (Indian event)
# "The Soviet Union has graciously offered to host peace talks in Tashkent to help end our war with Pakistan. As we prepare for the conference, we must consider what has occurred. Our excellent armed forces successfully thwarted the Pakistani plot to seize Kashmir from us. Our forces then proceeded to punish the Pakistanis across their borders. Although we made gains, we also lost some territory to Pakistan. However, our top diplomats believe we achieved our goal of not losing Kashmir and we can likely negotiate a return to prewar boundaries. The Pakistanis are likely to push for a resolution to the Kashmir problem, however, they are not in a position to demand the territory or that we implement the UN resolution. The cabinet urges the Prime Minister not to cave to potential Pakistani pressures."
# -Preparing for Tashkent (this plus Pakistan Post-War Assessment will lead in 60 days to event "Start of Tashkent Conference)
# Bengali Resentment (Pakistan event)
# "The recently concluded conflict with India has highlighted the anxiety and fears among many Bengalis in Pakistan. They felt the fighting in Kashmir occurred without consultation and resulted in a war that put East Pakistan in grave danger. In addition, many Bengalis felt the government focused its resources and troops on the Kashmir front, leaving the largest populated province of Pakistan vulnerable to enemy incursions. Bengali politicians and student leaders have addressed large crowds of protestors angry at what they felt was a failure of the military to protect them."
# -Tensions rising (national spirit three years "Bengali Wartime Anxiety" small drop in manpower recruitment, drop in stability, removes spirit "Bengali Patriotism" if present)
# Tashkent Conference Begins (global event)
# "The Soviet government is hosting the leaders of India and Pakistan in Tashkent for talks. The purpose of these talks is to reach a final agreement to end the recent war fought between the two South Asian powers. The war began when Pakistan attempted to de-freeze the current situation in Kashmir, this led to a military escalation that culminated into open war. The Pakistani leadership will be pushing for a settlement on Kashmir, preferably the implementation of previous UN resolutions on the issue. However, experts believe the Indian government will likely reject such pressures and instead press to make the pre-war ceasefire line the permanent border. Many analysts believe the conflict on the ground was largely inconclusive and it would be surprising if either party could convince the other. For the Soviets, the meeting gives them a chance to demonstrate their claim of being a neutral or friendly world power to the newly emerging post-colonial states."
# -The Conference Begins
# Pakistan Calls for Kashmir Solution (India)
# "The initial talks proved inconclusive, but following Soviet guidance, the Pakistani President and our Prime Minister to meet privately to discuss options for peace. During their talk, the Pakistani leader pressed us to implement the UN resolution on Kashmir and let the UN conduct a plebiscite. He stated that a failure to do so would only allow the conflict to fester and alienate the Kashmiris. After these talks, the Prime Minister discussed with his advisors. The consensus was that we remain firmly in control of our portion of Kashmir and should not legitimize Pakistani aggression by agreeing. Instead they stated we can offer to make the pre-war Kashmir cease fire line the permanent border. The Prime Minister heard these comments and must now decide whether he will go out on a limb and accept the Pakistani position or counter the offer."
# -Accept the Pakistan argument (leads to India Accepts Pakistani Position)
# -Make the counter-offer (leads to India Calls for Ceasefire line Being Made Permanent)
# India Accepts Pakistani Position (India event)
# "Against all his advisors, the Prime Minister announced his intentions to agree with Pakistan and implement UN resolution 47 on Kashmir. He stated that though the decision will not be popular at home, it will cement India as a mature power and be viewed positively in time. He added the people of Kashmir may see the Indian decision as positive and this may make the vote end in our favor. The Pakistani delegation and the Soviet mediators were thrilled by this decision. The initial reaction from the media has been largely negative. Many opposition politicians and editorials are already lambasting the government for surrendering to Pakistani aggression, with some even calling for the government to resign. Despite this uproar, the Prime Minister remains committed to his decision."
# -People will understand in time (leads to India Accepts Plebiscite event, rest of Tashkant Agreement tree does not fire at this point for Pakistan/India, ends the tree, India gains five year idea "Kashmir Betrayed" increase construction speed, drop in stability)
# Breakthrough in Tashkent on Kashmir (global event)
# "The international community was surprised to learn that India has agreed to approach the United Nations to implement resolution 47 and hold a plebiscite in Kashmir to determine its final status. Pakistan has long pushed for India to take this action and the recent war was largely fought to force a resolution on Kashmir. Although the military conflict ended inconclusively for Pakistan and many analysts predicted India would seek to restore the pre-war status quo. The United Nations have welcomed the decision, while nations across the globe are praising India for its statesmanship and desire for lasting peace in South Asia. The Pakistani government could barely conceal its glee over the announcement. The reaction in India has largely been of anger and shock at what many are calling a betrayal. To many Indians, they feel the decision is a concession to Pakistani military aggression."
# -Hopefully we will have peace
# We Have Achieved Our Objective (Pakistan event)
# "The Indian Prime Minister informed us of his decision to implement the UN resolution on Kashmir. This marks the completion of our primary foreign policy objective since independence. We have long felt the need to de-freeze Kashmir, which pushed our recent actions. The Indian decision confirms that our actions were just, and the people of Kashmir will finally achieve their true rights after years of struggle. The initial reaction of the media and leading politicians has been largely positive. As news spreads, we can expect jubilant crowds. This achievement is a testament to the hard work and sacrifices of our armed forces in the recent struggle. We have truly emerged as a leading power in the region and the world."
# -Pakistan Zindabad! (Tashkent Agreement tree will not fire, gain spirit, "Kashmir Success" five years, construction boost, and stability boost)
# India Calls for Ceasefire line Being Made Permanent (Pakistan event)
# "We tried to press India hard on taking this moment to implement the UN resolutions on Kashmir. We hoped they would see from our actions and resolve that as long as Kashmir remained uncertain, there was no possibility of future peace. Instead, the Indian Prime Minister informed us that he agreed Kashmir should be resolved but the solution was not to surrender the decision to a foreign body like the UN. Instead, he suggested the pre-war Kashmir borders be restored and made permanent. This is a big blow to our cause and the consensus is to reject the proposal outright. However, the President must consider whether accepting the permanent border, and the negative consequences are worth the benefits of normalizing relations and establishing peace and prosperity in the region."
# -Reject the idea
# -We should accept for future generations (leads to Pakistan Accepts Our Proposal to India, Tashkent Agreement Tree for Pakistan/India will not fire)
# Pakistan Accepts Our Proposal (Indian event)
# "The Pakistani President, much to the chagrin of his advisors, stated his acceptance at making the Kashmir border permanent. In his comments, he noted this was done out of a desire for permanent peace for the people of Pakistan, India, and Kashmir. Our delegation, along with the Soviet mediators were jubilant with the decision and word is already spreading back home at our success. We are already receiving congratulations from opposition leaders over the success in Tashkent. We have decisively proven that naked aggression cannot lead to success and our armed forces sacrifices were for the greater good."
# -Success! (Tashkent Agreement tree for India does not unlock, India gains 5 year idea, "Kashmir Success" stability boost and construction speed boost, launches event "Rage on Kashmir")
# Rage on Kashmir (Pakistan Event)
# "The reaction in Pakistan to the news in Kashmir has largely been one of disgust and outrage. During the recent conflict, the media portrayed Pakistan as achieving great military successes. Many are dumbfounded that after such supposed victories, how could the President surrender Kashmir. Many are claiming the battlefield victories have been surrendered in the peace talks. Already there are calls for solidarity marches for Kashmir to be held. Some members of the cabinet are expected to resign in protest, there are rumors of discontent within the ranks of the military as well. Regardless, the President remains firm and in a brief statement, mentioned the decision will lead to peace and open a path for Kashmiri families to be reunited."
# -Eventually they will understand (spirit five years "Kashmir Betrayed" decrease in construction and drop in stability, spirit ten years "Military Discontent" drop in organization/morale, Tashkent Agreement tree will not fire)
# Progress on Kashmir in Tashkent (global event)
# "In a surprise breakthrough in Tashkent, the Soviet government announced Pakistan and India had reached an agreement on Kashmir. Both sides agreed to return to pre-war borders and make the original ceasefire line the permanent border. The news is being well-received internationally, with many praising the Pakistani government specifically for recognizing the situation astutely and achieving a permanent breakthrough. The recent war fought between both states largely occurred over fighting in Kashmir. Though the fighting remained inconclusive, it appears the Pakistani and Indian leadership were interested in firmly solving the crisis. The Indian population is reacting positively to the news, although initial reports from Pakistan suggest backlash at the agreement."
# -Peace in South Asia?
# Pakistan Rejects Our Solution to Kashmir (India Event)
# "The Pakistani delegation flatly rejected our suggestion on making the Kashmir border permanent. Instead they reiterated their desire to implement the UN resolutions. It is clear that they are not willing to budge but are also not positioned to continue the fighting. We obviously cannot consider the Pakistani stance. Both us and the Pakistanis are facing intense pressure from the Soviet mediators to stabilize the situation. With the military situation ended inconclusively, it appears the only option left is to insist a return to the pre-war borders. Such a solution is not ideal, but will confirm that we succeeded in thwarting Pakistani aggression on Kashmir."
# -Insist on pre-war borders
# India Insists On Return to Prewar Situation (Pakistan Event)
# "It is clear the Indians are not willing to budge or be realistic on a solution to Kashmir. In addition, we are facing immense pressure from the Soviets to wrap up the talks and agree to a solution that ends the recent conflict. The Indians have stated they will accept a return to pre-war borders and exchange of POWs. This is not the scenario we wanted, but given the situation, we do not have a choice. Our people must be satisfied with the result that despite facing such a large enemy, our brave military was able to prevent them from achieving a decisive victory."
# -We accept (leads to event, "Zulfiqar Bhutto Lashes Out")
# Zulfiqar Bhutto Lashes Out (Pakistan event)
# "Foreign Minister Zulfiqar Bhutto, one of the more outspoken hawks within the government has reacted very negatively to the final agreement. He believes India will now act to make their occupation of Kashmir permanent and we should have continued the struggle. His loud denunciations are irritating to the President and it is likely that his days within the government are numbered. Privately, many within the cabinet believe Bhutto was instrumental in pushing the military to act on Kashmir and this action has led the government into the present situation."
# -Who cares about this upstart? (Leads to event Agreement Signed for Pakistan/India)
# Agreement Signed (Pakistan/India)
# "With smiles from Soviet mediators, the Pakistani and Indian leaders signed the Tashkent Agreement. The treaty stipulates both sides will withdraw their forces to their pre-war borders. The agreement also pledges both sides to exchange POWs from the recent conflict. In regard to Kashmir, the agreement stipulated both nations would continue to work on finding an eventual solution. Though the Pakistanis did not achieve a permanent solution on Kashmir. India wanted language which pledged both sides to find a solution only through peaceful means, but Pakistan was able to make the language much vaguer. Overall, the agreement confirms the inconclusive nature of the conflict."
# -Peace? (borders restored to pre-war boundaries, leads to event "Tashkent Agreement")
# Tashkent Agreement Signed (global)
# "After a week of negotiations in Tashkent, under Soviet mediation, Pakistan and India reached a final agreement. The Tashkent Agreement calls on a return to pre-war boundaries and exchange of POWs. Hopes for a final solution on Kashmir were not achieved as the agreement only urges both nations to continue talks. The agreement largely confirms the recent conflict was militarily inconclusive. The Indian delegation will likely be satisfied with the outcome, though the Pakistani delegation will likely face backlash. The international community has welcomed the agreement, hoping the restoration of peace in the region will pave the way for a future solution."
# -Peace for a time
# PM Shastri Dies in Tashkent! (Global event, fires if Shastri is Indian Prime Minister)
# "In a stunning development from Tashkent, news reached that Prime Minister Shastri suddenly passed away soon after signing the agreement. Initial reports suggest he passed away from a heart attack. The Indian delegation and parliament are said to be stunned by the news. Prime Minister Shastri, known for his humbleness and quiet devotion to the Indian nation, had led the country ably during the recent war with Pakistan. The Pakistani President was said to be shaken by the news and helped carry his body to the plane returning him home for a proper funeral. Despite his death, the Tashkent Agreement and its implementation is not expected to be changed."

# Pakistan Post-War Assessment (Pakistan event)
# "We must prepare for negotiations with the Indian government in Lahore. The recent war with India ended with us achieving a strong military position. Through the grace of God, our armed forces achieved its objectives in Kashmir and along the border. The Indian military was unable to seize our major cities and suffered severe setbacks in Kashmir and elsewhere. Following the ceasefire, it was clear we are in a strong position to dictate terms to the Indians. Many in the cabinet are advocating we use our success to force India into settling Kashmir. We launched our operations in order to de-freeze Kashmir and have largely succeeded in our plans. Now is the time to press our claims."
# -Prepare for Lahore (in a few days fires event "Rejuvenated Bengali Patriotism")
# Indian Post-War Assessment (India event)
# "We must prepare for negotiations with the Pakistani government in Lahore. The recent war with Pakistan did not go as we had hoped. Our forces suffered major setbacks in Kashmir and along the wider border. We failed to capture any valuable cities from Pakistan and cannot use that as a bargaining chip in the talks. It is clear the Pakistanis will press us on Kashmir and demand we vacate the province. Our best approach will be to push for the implementation of UN resolution 47. Ironically a reversal of our previous policy, if Pakistan instead pushes for us to vacate the province, we can then offer a partition plan that would allow us to hold on to Ladakh and Jammu. We must try our best in the upcoming talks to achieve an honorable result."
# -On to Lahore
# Rejuvenated Bengali Patriotism (Pakistan event)
# "The Bengalis in East Pakistan have long harbored suspicions of being second-class citizens or being overlooked by the federal government. This despite their large population, huge economic role, and historical devotion to the Pakistan Movement. When war initially broke out over Kashmir, rumors spread that West Pakistan had abandoned East Pakistan. However, as the Pakistan military began achieving military victories, those apprehensions soon dissolved. The Bengali press praised the military successes, while the military and federal government offered their admiration to the support and sacrifices made by the people of East Pakistan. With the war over and peace talks about to commence, Bengali patriotism towards Pakistan appears renewed. To reciprocate this new feeling of unity, the Pakistan government announced the inclusion of a prominent Bengali provincial leader as part of the Pakistani negotiating team for the Lahore talks."
# -Pakistan Zindabad (new national spirit "Bengali Patriotism" big stability boost, small construction boost for 3 years)
# Indian Delegation Reaches Lahore (Pakistan/India event)
# "The Indian delegation, headed by their Prime Minister, recently arrived in Lahore for talks on ending the recent South Asian war. The press noted none of the Indian representatives appeared anything but serious over their mission. Before arriving, the Indian Prime Minister informed his nation  that he was going to negotiate with Pakistan in the hopes of securing a just peace, the return of occupied Indian lands and soldiers being held as POWs. The Pakistani President and his delegation are already in Lahore, formal talks will begin in the next couple days. Although the Pakistani press had been noisily boasting over the successful position Pakistan is in, the government recently requested such writings be temporarily halted to facilitate a friendly atmosphere for the peace talks."
# -Peace in Lahore? (couple days later, India Makes Kashmir Offer fires)
# India Makes Kashmir Offer (Pakistan offer)
# "During the initial talks, we told the Indians our principle objective was to establish a final peace in Kashmir. As we are in a militarily dominant position in Kashmir and along the border, we certainly have the advantage. However, the Indians surprised our delegation by offering to implement UN resolution 47 on Kashmir, as we had demanded for years. They say now is the moment for both of our nations to step back and let the Kashmiri people choose their destiny. Certainly, this is what we have always wanted, but our position is such that we can simply demand India vacate Kashmir and not risk an international vote, which could potentially be interfered with by the Indians. We may never have such a strong negotiating position ever again and leaving it to the UN may backfire. However, accepting the Indian offer and then gaining Kashmir through a UN vote would make our success more legitimate internationally."
# -Accept the Indian Offer (India gets "Pakistan Accepts Our Kashmir Offer")
# -India must leave Kashmir (india gets "Pakistan Insists India Vacate Kashmir")
# Pakistan Accepts Our Kashmir Offer (Indian event)
# "In a surprising change of events, the Pakistani government accepted our offer to implement UN resolution 47. This result will leave the future of Kashmir to its residents and they may potentially choose to join us, though it appears unlikely. Regardless, this is a far more favorable result than being asked to completely vacate Kashmir. With this agreement, we can expect a return to pre-war borders on the international border along with a prisoner exchange, once we commit to the United Nations route. Rumors of the agreement are being well-received by the Indian press, with many seeing this result as far more palatable than the alternative."
# -Best case scenario (event, "India Agrees to Plebiscite" fires, starting that event chain, also fires "Indian Offer Accepted in Lahore" for Pakistan, Treaty of Lahore FT options will not open for India)
# Indian Offer Accepted in Lahore (Pakistan event)
# "The Pakistani President addressed the nation with regards to peace talks in Lahore. He stated the Indian government had offered to wholly commit itself to implementing UN resolutions on Kashmir. He stated that empowering the people of Kashmir is the only modest desire of the people of Pakistan. The UN resolution will pave the way for Kashmiris to decide once and for all which nation they wish to join. The English press in Pakistan is praising the President for achieving Pakistani objectives in a way that does not humiliate India and preserve the international standing of the nation. The Urdu press, however, is much more scathing, accusing the government of picking international image over using their position of strength to force India out. For them, the Indians had years to implement the resolution but chose not to, they should have been humbled. There are also rumors within the military expressing disappointment that battlefield victories were not converted to a more concrete victory."
# -the people will understand (leads to event "Kashmir Agreement Reached in Lahore", Treaty of Lahore FT options will not open for Pakistan, India-Pakistan borders restored to pre-war conditions as the Plebiscite event chain goes on to determine the final status of Kashmir)
# Kashmir Agreement Reached in Lahore (global event)
# "The world reacted positively to news that Pakistan and India had agreed to implement UN resolutions on Kashmir to establish a final resolution to the disputed territory. Indeed, the recent war fought between the two sides was over who controlled Kashmir. India was forced to offer the implementation of the resolutions as the military conflict left them in a very weak position. Because of this, the agreement surprised some observers who thought Pakistan would simply use its position to force India out of Kashmir and take it for itself. It appears the Pakistanis are working to not force a peace that would provoke further animosity from India or give an international image of Pakistan as a militarily aggressive power. It is also clear the Pakistanis were confident the vote will give Kashmir to them."
# -hopefully the UN will bring peace
# Pakistan Insists India Vacate Kashmir (Indian event)
# "The Pakistani government responded coldly to our offer to implement the UN resolution. They noted this was something we could have done years ago and to offer it now, with the current situation, it was a disingenuous way for them to save face. The Pakistanis instead stated that the Indian situation in Kashmir was clearly untenable and India should vacate the former Princely State. The Pakistanis softened this hardline stance by adding that if we comply, they will immediately restore the international border to the pre-war borders and exchange POWs. Certainly we cannot permanently accept the occupation of major Indian cities. However, some advisors suggest we offer the Pakistanis a partition plan for Kashmir in which we retain Jammu and Ladakh, this would allow each part of Kashmir to be with their co-religionists."

# -Offer a Kashmir Partition (leads to India Asks for Partition)
# India Asks for Partition (Pakistan event)
# "After we informed the Indians our intention was not to play games with regards to Kashmir, they made an intriguing offer. The Indians noted that historically Jammu was non-Muslim and the First Kashmir War drove many non-Muslims from the Valley to Jammu. That population would be apprehensive to a Pakistani government and to prevent animosity or a new cycle of communal unrest, perhaps we should partition Kashmir. They would give us all of Kashmir except for Jammu and Ladakh. Accepting this Partition Plan would achieve our goal of controlling the Valley and remove the potential headache of integrating Kashmiri non-Muslims. It would also avoid us inheriting the Indian border dispute with China. We should consider the option, however, some of the more hawkish delegates believe we should secure all of Kashmir and finally make Pakistan whole."
# -Accept the Partition Plan (leads to event "Pakistan Accepts Partition Proposal" for India, Treaty of Lahore FT focuses will fire)
# -Insist India abandon Kashmir (leads to event "Pakistan Will Not Budge" for India)
# Pakistan Will Not Budge (Indian event)
# "The Pakistanis have revealed their naked ambitions by rejecting our latest partition proposal on Kashmir. The Pakistanis have stated they will withdraw their forces from our territory and exchange POWs once our forces begin their evacuation from Kashmir. Our situation is untenable, the longer Pakistani forces occupy our lands the weaker the state and government look. Though it pains us, we have no choice but comply and sign the agreement. The military and population will no doubt be furious by this change of events. The Pakistanis are thinking very short sighted, though they may succeed now, the people of India will never abandon those Kashmiris we have protected since 1947."
# -The struggle will continue (leads to event "Treaty of Lahore Signed")
# Pakistan Accepts Partition Proposal (Indian event)
# "The Pakistani government, after taking time to consider our proposal, have agreed to partition Kashmir. We immediately gave orders for our forces to withdraw to the new borders. The final agreement will see both of our nations return to the international pre-war borders and begin the process of exchanging prisoners. Although our people and the opposition will be disappointed with the result, we can at least argue that we have preserved our commitment to the victims of the initial tribal invasion of Kashmir. Given a bad situation, we have come up as well as could be expected."
# -Peace for now (leads to event "Pakistan and India Conclude Kashmir Partition", pre-war borders are restored, except in Kashmir where India is only left with Jammu and Ladakh, Treaty of Lahore FT focuses will fire)
# Pakistan and India Conclude Kashmir Partition (global event)
# "The international community was pleased to see that Pakistan and India agreed on a final agreement to end their recent war in Lahore. After intense negotiations, Pakistan agreed to partition Kashmir with India. The Kashmir Valley and the territory already controlled by Pakistan will be under its control. India retains its control of Ladakh and Jammu. Both sides agreed this solution would allow all Kashmiris to reside where they are most comfortable. Despite this, there are already reports of non-Muslim Kashmiris moving to Jammu and India. This agreement marks a major setback for India and confirms their military defeat on the battlefield. For Pakistan, their government is celebrating the treaty as the completion of the nation. Plans are already underway for the President to visit Srinagar."
# - Hopefully there will be peace
# Treaty of Lahore Signed (global event)
# "The President of Pakistan and Prime Minister of India signed the Treaty of Lahore to end their recent military conflict. The agreement confirms the Pakistani military victory as India agreed to withdraw completely from Kashmir. In exchange, both sides will return to pre-war borders along the international border and exchange POWs. The reaction in Pakistan has been complete jubilation. Mosques are proclaiming the details of the treaty, causing crowds to gather in celebration. In India, the treaty is being viewed as the ultimate humiliation. Reports are already arriving of non-Muslim Kashmiris fleeing to India, their arrival will only emphasize what was lost. Many observers believe despite the Pakistani victory, the situation between the two nations will not likely improve with this agreement."
# -Peace for now (opens the Treaty of Lahore FT focuses for Pakistan, fires event "Indian Despair Over Treaty" for India)
# Indian Despair Over Treaty (Indian event)
# "The Treaty of Lahore is being very negatively received in India. The opposition has been especially brutal in their criticism of the government in its handling of the war and its aftermath. There are reports of unrest among junior officers who feel the senior leadership and government failed the cause. There are some reports of civilians verbally abusing men in uniform and government officials. Of more concern is the arrival of pro-Indian Kashmiri refugees, their leaders are already publishing condemning editorials in major newspapers. We must work hard to reunite the nation and prepare for the future. Pakistan certainly had the upper hand this time, but we will no doubt eventually find our moment to strike."

# Treaty of Delhi chain
# Conditions required for Treaty of Delhi (India retains Srinagar, Jammu, Amristar, Calcutta, and controls Lahore or Karachi and either Dacca or Islamabad)
# Pakistan Post-War Assessment (Pakistan event)
# "The recent conflict with India ended disastrously. We not only failed to force India into resolving Kashmir but in the course of the conflict we now have Pakistani cities under Indian occupation. Militarily we have very little leverage. The people of Pakistan want their families united and their soldiers back home. However, it is clear the cost for this maybe at the expense of Kashmir. As our delegation prepares for Delhi, we must seek for a ceasefire and restoration of the pre-war status quo. If this fails, we will press for a partition of Kashmir with us retaining Gilgit-Baltistan. We will try to make that the permanent border to salvage at least something from the situation. However, the military situation is such that if India presses for us to vacate Kashmir, we will likely have no choice."
# -We must trust in God
# Indian Post-War Assessment (India event)
# "The recent conflict escalated only after Pakistan launched a devious campaign of violence in Kashmir. Their efforts to forcibly seize the territory failed and in the resulting war our forces have proven superior. We have the military advantage and control enough territory to negotiate from a position of strength. Many of the hawks within the government will put pressure on us to demand all of Kashmir, including Gilgit-Baltistan. While this certainly makes sense, we have to consider the challenges in incorporating so much land and a population brainwashed for decades to hate our nation. It may be better to consider alternative plans but not squander the advantage our brave men secured for us on the battlefield."
# -Prepare for our guests
# Bengali Resentment (Pakistan event)
# "The recently concluded conflict with India has highlighted the anxiety and fears among many Bengalis in Pakistan. They felt the fighting in Kashmir occurred without consultation and resulted in a war that put East Pakistan in grave danger. In addition, many Bengalis felt the government focused its resources and troops on the Kashmir front, leaving the largest populated province of Pakistan vulnerable to enemy incursions. Bengali politicians and student leaders have addressed large crowds of protestors angry at what they felt was a failure of the military to protect them."
# -Tensions rising (national spirit three years "Bengali Wartime Anxiety" small drop in manpower recruitment, drop in stability, removes spirit "Bengali Patriotism" if present)
# Pakistan Calls for Pre-War Borders (Indian event)
# "The initial talks between us and Pakistan were very tense. During the most recent discussions they offered to return the region to the pre-war situation of one month before fighting began in Kashmir. They state this will preserve the delicate status quo of Kashmir and prevent further enflaming of emotions on both sides of the border. Obviously, this is a desperate ploy by the Pakistanis, we will soon inform the Pakistanis that it was they who upset the status quo. Because of this they must recognize the new reality on the ground, as such we will state that Pakistan must cede all of its occupied Kashmir to us. The Kashmir Princely State acceded to India and Pakistan must recognize this reality."
# -Inform Pakistan of the facts
# India Insists on all of Kashmir (Pakistan event)
# "Our efforts at trying to restore the pre-war borders was soundly rejected. The Indians are in no mood to consider this. They feel like we caused the unrest and they cannot stop until they get something from us. Our next option is to trade our claim to the Kashmir Valley for a restoration of peace. We will propose a partition for Kashmir where we retain Gilgit and Baltistan but cede the rest to India. We have been defeated this time, but we will recover and never abandon Kashmir."
# -Hopefully they accept this (India gets "Pakistan Asks for Partition")
# Pakistan Asks for Partition
# "The Pakistani delegation has realized we are not in a mood to let them off the hook. In the latest rounds of talk they have offered to cede their so-called Azad Kashmir to us but asked to retain Gilgit-Baltistan. During the First Kashmir War, Gilgit-Baltistan quickly fell to the Pakistanis as they had the support of local militia forces there. Their proposal may make a great deal of sense for us. We would avoid inheriting a hostile population and succeed in uniting the Kashmir Valley. Internationally it would also be a welcomed outcome. However, many of our hawks are saying we cannot lose this advantage and we should press the Pakistanis to leave Kashmir."
# -We can accept this partition (Pakistan gets "India Accepts the Partition Plan")
# -Pakistan must leave Kashmir (Pakistan gets "India Will not Budge")
# India Accepts the Partition Plan (Pakistan event)
# "The Indian government has accepted our proposal on partitioning Kashmir. With a heavy heart, we have already given orders for our officials and remaining troops to leave Azad Kashmir. Already there are reports of Kashmiri families fleeing to safety in Pakistan. However, considering the alternative, this was the best result. We will never abandon Kashmir however, our hands are tied. The Indian government has agreed to withdraw their own forces from our territory and exchange POWs and restore diplomatic ties. We can only pray the future will give us an opportunity to right this historical injustice."

Due to the military balance, we are left with no choice but to comply. With a heavy heart, we must order our forces out of Kashmir. The consequences and backlash will be immense from the people. However, we have no choice, but considering the injustice of the situation, in time, we will be redeemed. Our delegates will soon sign the final treaty."
