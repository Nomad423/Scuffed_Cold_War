  Xmas.1.d:0 "The program of tracking Santa Claus by the North American Aerospace Defense Command began on December 24, 1955; when the phone number for the NORAD Continental Air Defense (CONAD) command center was accidentally misprinted on an ad for a Sears department store offering phone calls to Santa. Phones began ringing at CONAD's center in Colorado Springs, even coming through the dreaded red telephone, where commands from higher authorities would come. Seeing a potential public relations campaign, Colonel Harry Shoup and CONAD began 'tracking' Santa and spreading the word of Santa's location for children around the world. Today, NORAD continues the tradition by operating 'tracking' online, and people around the world can still see Santa's location down to the minute!"
  Xmas.2.d:0 "In the Soviet Union New Year's Eve became a truly national holiday to replace Christmas. This was preceded by the abolition of Christmas in 1929. New Year's Day was celebrated for the first time in 1935. The old attributes of Christmas were secularized - Ded Moroz, the fir tree, and presents underneath. In 1937 Ded Moroz got an obligatory companion - the Snegurochka. Soviet times also saw their own attributes of the New Year; tangerines, Olivier salad, the strike of the Kremlin Chimes during which one must make a wish, and the festive address of the state leader to the citizens. In the Russian Empire on New Year's Eve balls were held, in Soviet times they were replaced by "Ogonek" concerts and feasts, which are accompanied by traditional songs such as "V lesu rodilas' yolochka and "Five minutes"."
  Xmas.3.d:0 "Christmas at the White House in Washington, DC, has always been a tradition among every president. Most important is the White House Christmas Tree, first unofficially used in the 1850s but not continued until 1961, when Jacqueline Kennedy selected a tree and used a Nutcracker theme. Most often selected from the state of North Carolina, the tree is donated by the National Christmas Tree Association and is displayed in the Blue Room of the White House. Coming in at around 18 feet tall, the tree is decorated in a specific theme every year, with ornaments frequently coming from schoolchildren, members of the military, or those in hospitals. Continuing to this day, it is a time-honored tradition that exemplifies the American spirit during the holiday season."
  Xmas.4.d:0 "Straying away from traditional live Christmas trees, the first artificial variety, the short-lived aluminum Christmas tree, came into being in the mid-1950s, becoming extremely popular in the 1960s in the United States. Known as the 'Evergleam', over a million aluminum trees a year were produced by the Aluminum Specialty Company in Manitowoc, Wisconsin. The end of the aluminum Christmas tree can be credited with the 1965 premiere of A Charlie Brown Christmas, which painted the trees as a symbol of the over-commericalization of Christmas. Remaining to this day as a forlorn cultural icon or staying dusty in basements, the aluminum Christmas tree represents a temporary fad in American culture."
  Xmas.5.d:0 "Perhaps the most curious Christmas tradition throughout the world is the United Kingdom's Royal Institution Christmas Lectures. Begun in 1825 as a way to promote organized education on science, the tradition of presentations of scientific phenomena has continued to stay alive, having begun to be televised in 1965 on the BBC. Figures such as Michael Faraday, Carl Sagan, and David Attenborough have lectured, making science fun for the public during the holiday season. "
