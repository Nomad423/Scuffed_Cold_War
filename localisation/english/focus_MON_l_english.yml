 mongolia.1.d:0 "Under the boot of Stalin and his Communist puppets in Mongolia, the people of the region have suffered greatly. Since its establishment in 1921, the Mongolian People's Republic has been plagued with purges and massacres completely uprooting the Mongolian people's way of life and having a devastating impact on the population. Despite claiming to represent the people, the Mongolian People's Party has forced the people into collectivizing their livestock while practically eradicated the Buddhist religion. Their desecrated temples remaining as a scorched reminders of lost times. Discontent with Soviet rule has been growing and the population has grown increasingly unhappy with Communist rule. Although not a threat to Soviet rule yet, the rising anti-Soviet sentiment throughout Mongolia is a danger Stalin cannot afford to ignore."
 mongolia.2.d:0 "Our dear leader, Khorloogiin Choibalsan has died at the age of 56 from kidney cancer in Moscow. He will be remembered as a hero, a patriot, and ultimately a martyr for the cause of Mongolian independence. His body has been returned with full military honors and he was given a state funeral in the capital which was attended by Mongolian and Soviet officials alike. He was buried in Altan Ulgii cemetery in Ulaanbaatar, but work has begun on a mausoleum in front of the Government Palace."
 mongolia.3.d:0 "\nDespite the enthusiasm among the Mongolian communist leaders, the Soviet Union rejected their application to become a constituent republic within the country. Although the Soviets appreciate the Mongolian commitment to socialism and the Soviet model, many among the Soviets believe the nation is far too undeveloped to be incorporated. There were also some fears that incorporating Mongolia may end up antagonizing the Soviet socialist allies in China and East Asia. The Mongolian government was said to be disappointed by the decision and pledged it would continue the revolutionary development of the country with Soviet guidance. Within the Mongolian communist party however, there are rumors that many within the party opposed the plan and may have privately urged Soviet officials to reject the proposal as well."
 mongolia.11.d:0 "The Mongolian communist party concluded public discussions and reports regarding the past transgressions and excesses of violence which occurred during the Great Purge from 1937 to 1939. The Party regrets the loss of lives and cultural destruction during the period. More importantly, the Party decided to rehabilitate purged party members who were condemned for being overly nationalistic. Many in the party blame the role of Soviet advisors, especially from the NKVD who are accused of directing and controlling the violence, which included torture and the establishment of prison camps. The communist leader of the period, the beloved Marshal Choibalsan was also criticized for committing mistakes during this time and building a cult of personality. Some of the party old guard is uncomfortable with these proceedings."
 mongolia.20.d:0 "General Secretary Dashiin Damba has recently been removed from power following a power struggle within the Mongolian communist party. Damba had recently played a major role in de-Stalinization efforts along with pushing the country to engage with other socialist oriented Asian powers instead of just the Soviet Union. The Party old guard took umbrage to the de-Stalinization, especially criticism of the former leader, Marshal Choibalsan. It is this faction which orchestrated the ouster of Damba and the purge of his close associates. The Soviet Union is likely to be satisfied with this development as this will help solidify the leadership of the pro-Moscow faction in the party."
 mongolia.7.d:0 "Mongolia has had a complicated and unstable history since the fall of the Mongol Empire. In the mess of warlord-era Chinese politics, the small and isolated nation of Mongolia was forgotten by the great powers and thus never received any formal recognition. After Bogd Khan and the occupying Chinese forces were ousted by the Red Army in 1921, the country was effectively under Soviet control and lacked any official statehood. Despite independently taking part in the battles against Japan during World War 2, Mongolia's independence was still only recognized by the Soviets. However, with the Cold War intensifying throughout the world, the Soviet Union has led to a considerable intensification in efforts to give the Mongols recognition as an independent state. This move represents a major step forward for the Mongolian national identity, and could possibly give Mongolia its status as a universally recognized power back for the first time since the 14th century."
 mongolia.21.d:0 "During in extraordinary Central Committee meeting, Prime Minister Yumjaagiin Tsedenbal was removed from office. A major figure in the party since he first became General Secretary in 1940, his removal indicates the party had grown wary of his industrialization efforts and devotion to Moscow. His removal is likely the result of the recent de-Stalinization efforts which heavily criticized Tsedenbal party mentors. His association with the previous leadership has made his position untenable as the newer party leadership wishes to move on. The new Prime Minister has not been named yet but will be expected to keep ties strong with Moscow and also push Mongolia into stronger relations with other Asian socialist states. It is unknown whether Tsendenbal has been stripped of his party membership or simply removed from senior posts."
 AJAX.900.d:0 "The new Iranian government of Ahmad Qavam consented to the restoration of the Qajar dynasty. The young Hamid Mirza Qajar, son of the former Crown Prince will become Shah. The Iranian government characterized this as a restoration of a historical wrong. Noting Reza Pahlavi usurped the throne through machinations, violence, and with foreign forces. It was this tendency of ruthlessness and consorting with foreign powers that kept the Iranian nation weak in recent years. The Qajar restoration brings back a dynasty from the eighteenth century and will reinvigorate the natural connections between not just the monarchy and the people but also the monarchy and the clergy."
 AJAX.911.d:0 "The public position of the Shah deteriorated further following the holding of mass rallies against the Shah by the radical Fadaiyan-i-Islam group. The group, using its contacts among the clergy were able to rally supporters during the Friday prayers and bring them to the streets across the country. The protestors condemned the westernizing policies of the Pahlavi dynasty, its commitment to imperial powers, and what it called the oppression of Islam. The mobilization of the religious communities in Iran is a major blow to the Shah who is already facing public uproar over his autocratic tendencies and perceived status as an imperial stooge."
 mongolia_prc_1_desc:0 "In a formal communique, the [PRC.GetName] has offered a few hundred thousand Han Chinese workers to Outer Mongolia in order to help with modernizing our country. This would doubtlessly be incredibly useful in ensuring our role in the Communist world. However, the [MON.GetName] is a very small nation, relatively speaking, with not very many ethnic Mongolians living in our nation. If we accept these Han Chinese workers, we would have far more ethnic Chinese than we could possibly assimilate, and there is a potential that the [PRC.GetName] will attempt to integrate our nation."
 inner_mongol_13_desc:0 "Earlier today, the [PRC.GetName] announced they would be allowing and encouraging the migration of Mongolian people from the region of Inner Mongolia and into Outer Mongolia, or the [MON.GetName]. This is following an initial request for a ceding of the entire Inner Mongolia region, something apparently found ridiculous by the Chinese Government, which vehemently denied the request. However, their formal request for a migration treaty of sorts was accepted as an act of goodwill, and the movement towards Mongolian unity is celebrated in Ulaanbaatar tonight."
 inner_mongol_14_desc:0 "Earlier today, the [MON.GetName] has reported their displeasure with the Chinese government due to their aggressive refusal to work with the Mongolian government in their attempts to integrate the Inner Mongolian populations into their domain. Initially, [PRC.GetName] denied an initial attempt to organize a cession of the Inner Mongolian region into their state with the hope of better relations following the transference of the region. When the [MON.GetName] sent another communique requesting an open migration policy, the [PRC.GetName] further denied them. Tonight, many in Mongolia are left feeling frustrated at the lack of cooperation."
 inner_mongol_12_desc:0 "The damned [PRC.GetName] has further soiled our aims to unite the Mongols. Out of a misguided attempt at fighting us tooth and nail out of spite, they have denied both of our requests, instead favoring a staunch position of what almost seems like anti-Mongolian sentiment. Unfortunately, we will have to wait for our union."
 inner_mongol_11_desc:0 "Although the [PRC.GetName] refused our initial request for transference of Altaic lands, they have tentatively accepted the request for open migration of the peoples of Inner Mongolia into Outer Mongolia. This decision is not exactly what we wanted, but union of our people is nevertheless a good thing."
 inner_mongol_10_desc:0 "Although we rebuffed their earlier communique, we received yet another message from the Mongolian government. Apologizing for their presumptiveness, [PRC.GetLeader] has requested a treaty for open migration for Altaic peoples into their land, furthering their mission of unity of their people. Though this is less of an annoyance than the previous request, some still hold issue with the idea of appeasing the Mongols."
 
 inner_mongol_1_desc:0 "Although Inner Mongolia has not been a part of the Mongolian nation since the fall of the empire of Temujin, the Altaic people still inhabit vast swathes of the steppes of inner Mongolia, now a part of Northern China. More so, a vocal population of this region desires a united steppe, and a Greater Mongolian sphere reunited at last. However, the [PRC.GetName] controls these vast steppes, and may not see our point of view when it comes to our acquisition of their lands. We can only send our request, and hope for the best."
 inner_mongol_2_desc:0 "At noon today, we received a communique from [MON.GetName]. Within the communique was a detailed request for the ceding of the territories of inner Mongolia to [MON.GetName] in what [MON.GetLeader] described as an \"ancestral and ethnic right to unity of peoples\". While it is true that this would be a notable act of goodwill towards the Altaic peoples of the region, as well as something that would establish better relations between our countries, many vocal members of our government have responded to this request hostilely, stating in plain terms that we do not owe the Mongol people anything. "
 inner_mongol_3_desc:0 "China has denied our request in an unfortunate turn of events. [PRC.GetLeader] has claimed that \"The Chinese people do not owe the Mongolians anything.\" refusing our attempt for a unity of peoples. However, we may be able to convince our neighbors to participate in an open migration treaty that would allow our brothers in the south to resettle in our lands."
 inner_mongol_4_desc:0 "China has accepted our request. In a few short words, [PRC.GetLeader] effectively handed over Inner Mongolia, citing the animosity in the past and a hope for further friendship between the two nations. Although the transference of land may take some time, this is a landmark achievement for diplomacy."
 inner_mongol.5.d:0 "Earlier today, the [PRC.GetName] proclaimed that it would be ceding the lands of Inner Mongolia to the [MON.GetName], citing the prolific Altaic peoples in the region, as well as a desire to better relations between the two nations. Although the lands have not been properly owned by a Mongolian state since the Yuan dynasty, the Mongolian government has claimed their desire for a union of Mongolian people. In Ulaanbaatar, the populace has taken to the streets in celebration of this crowning achievement of diplomacy."
