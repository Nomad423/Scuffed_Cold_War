 prc.50.d:0 "Mao Zedong announced in Beijing today that he would be stepping down today as Premier of the People's Republic of China. He stated that it is time for retirement and wished to spend more time with the people. Some of Mao's supporters stated that he was forced down after some of his reforms for being too radical. They would hunt down the anti-Maoists until China is pure again. The next leader of the Chinese people will be announced soon."
 prc.85.d:0 "Deng Xiaoping has been removed from his positions as Vice Chairman of the Chinese Communist Party and other political position. Mao Zedong said in his speech today that Deng has been imprisoned for being being a counter-revolutionary and in his role of anti-government acts against the Party leadership. Mao Zedong's campaign against reformists and anti-Maoists continue as part of his \"Cultural Revolution\". Many cheered as Mao continued on his speech and the removal of Deng. Many of Mao's critics have stated that Deng was removed only because he was a critic of Mao, and that he wanted a more liberal China. Mao's Cultural Revolution continues as China returns to its true self."
 prc.75.d:0 "Lin Biao, one of our closest allies and generals, has crashed and died while trying to defect to the U.S.S.R. It seems he was the leader of Project 571. Project 571 is the Codename for our beloved leader, Mao Zedong, be assassinated and then a coup would be launched against the Party leadership. Any of Pro-Mao Forces would be removed or executed. However, several of our officials have discovered the plot and tried to arrest him. He escaped with his family, but while over Mongolia he crashed due to a fuel malfunction. With reports found in his office of the Soviets offering to support his coup and his leadership, this makes us question if the Soviets are really on our side. We must be on the watch for anymore dissents in our government." 
 prc.86.d:0 "Liu Shaqoi has been imprisoned by Mao Zedong after Mao Zedong said in another speech that Shaqoi was arrested for being a traitor to the government and the party. Mao stated that Shaqoi was a supporter of Capitalism and wanted to undermine the Chinese people for the betterment of himself. Shaqoi has also been accused of supporting acts of terrorism against the Chinese government. Many of Mao's critics have stated that this is another way for Mao to gain more power and remove any opposition to him. Mao has revealed that more of his \"Cultural Revolution\" policies will continue and grow to remove any traitors within the government. "
