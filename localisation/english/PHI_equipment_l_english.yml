The M1 Garand is a .30 caliber semi-automatic rifle that saw extensive use during WWII. It is amongst the first weapons to use a gas reloading system to rechamber a new round after firing. It uses clips loaded from the top of the rifle and can be fitted with accessories including the M31 HEAT anti-tank rifle grenade.

It became the standard-issue rifle for the U.S. military in 1959 replacing the M1 Garand rifle in the U.S. Army by 1958 and the U.S. Marine Corps by 1965. It was the last American battle rifle issued in quantity to U.S. military personnel. The power of the 7.62×51mm NATO cartridge allowed it to penetrate cover quite well and reach out to extended range. It saw service mainly in numerous wars in Indochina but it's main spotlight was during the Vietnam War. After its replacement by the M16 it saw export to numerous members."

In 1959 the weapon was finished by Eugene Stoner and James Sullivan. It displayed exceptional capability and outclassed the AK47 and the AKM. Most notably, the weapon has much more firepower than the M2 carbine and was more accurate than the AK47 as well as carried lighter ammunition at minimal loss in proficiency. However, despite outclassing the AK47 in general tests, it had poor reliability that could cause it to not be considered its equal. Especially in Vietnam, where failures were very common."

In 1982 the redesign and improvements were made. The weapon featured a strengthened receiver, new rifling, a strengthened case, better cooling as a result of different materials, improved support for attachables, and a redesigned internal mechanism that gave it a high level of reliability. It has seen combat in Lebanon, Libya, Egypt, and any other conflicts the US has been in since its inception."

It was initially commissioned to be designed by a large ad-hoc team of designers in 1984 and development finished in 1993. After 9 years in development, hopefully it would have been worth the wait. It features a greater level of reliability and is much lighter and shorter. Mostly due to improved materials, it is more accurate than the M16A2. Its compact size makes it more versatile and easier to operate than the M16A2. The M4 carbine has seen combat in the US war in Afghanistan, the Iraq war, and in the war against ISIS."
