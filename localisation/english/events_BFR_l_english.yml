 BFR.103.d:0 "After intense fighting in the capital of Lagos, commandos from the Republic of Biafra and the Republic of Benin have taken over the heavily barricaded city center. While the government officials of Nigeria had already fled to the northern provinces weeks ago, this showed that the war was essentially lost for the Federal State. With morale entirely demolished and no feasible counter operation at this point being possible the Nigerian government has agreed in a meeting with Ojukwu in neutral Ivory Coast for a ceasefire."
 BFR.104.d:0 "This afternoon the ceasefire ending the Nigerian Civil War was signed in neutral Ivory Coast between [NGA.GetLeader] and C. Odumegwu Ojukwu marking an end to the most bloody conflict in African History. While the agreement involved official recognition by Nigeria, many major nations such as the United States and United Kingdom were unsure whether they would recognize the new successionist state. However when France formally recognized the independence of the small nation, the rest of the world soon followed with Biafra joining the United Nations as an official member. The world now welcomes the new republic which its people call 'Land of the Rising Sun'"
 BFR.105.d:0 "Initially when our Republic was pushing into the Niger Delta things were looking very promising as the strategic value of the resources in the region were greatly to our advantage. However, it immediately became clear that with the Federal Nigerian government breathing down our necks that this non-ethnic Igbo region could not safely be a part of Biafra. Instead Doctor Albert Okonkwo persuaded Ojukwu to make an independent republic in the region which will back the Biafran movement while also being a separate independent nation which would cater to local ethnic particularists desires and apply for UN membership."
 BFR.106.d:0 "Today the world's newest nation has been declared, the Republic of Benin. Intended to be a UN recognized sovereign state, the country was truly created by the Biafran government in non-Igbo occupied territory in a way to expand control of the resource rich Niger Delta state without unrest of ethnic minorities in the Delta. Taking some inspiration of the Ijaw Delta Republic which declared independence a few years earlier the nation has tried to make propaganda for itself which mostly aligns the people with the Biafran cause and the supposed tyranny of the Nigerian Federal Government."
 BFR.107.d:0 "A large firing squad executes dozens of former officers of Biafra today as a series of controversial trials took place in the small nation. Generals Victor Banjo and Emmanuel Ifeajuna were accused of trying to over throw the government and end the nation of Biafra while their defense was that they were attempting to negotiate a ceasefire with the Federal Government as they believed the succeeding of Biafra is a futility that will only continue to cause hundreds of thousands of more deaths. Of course Ojukwu wasn't going to take any of these claims seriously and signed off on their execution following their expedient trial."
 BFR.108.d:0 "Patrick Chukwuma Nzeogwu, one of the chief orchestrators of the Coup of the Five majors, has died this week in defending Biafra. Nzeogwu returned to the Igbo heartland following his release on the eve of the civil war, due to the fact that Yakubu Gowon wished to stabilize the country by releasing political prisoners. While leading an army in a reconnaissance operation he became trapped in an ambush and there are varying accounts of what happened with some stating he died in combat while others say he was going to be taken prisoner but committed suicide to avoid the humiliation due to his reputation."
