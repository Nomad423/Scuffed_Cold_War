 PDG_infantry_equipment_0_desc:0 "An Iconic bolt-action rifle adopted by the Wehrmacht in 1935 as the standard service rifle. It was one of the final developments in the long line of Mauser military rifles. Although supplemented by semi- and fully automatic rifles during World War II, it remained the primary German service rifle until the end of the war in 1945. Despite the growing number of semi-automatic and fully automatic rifles, the Kar98k continues to see use in both sides of the Iron Curtain."

 PDG_infantry_equipment_1_desc:0 "The AK47 is a fully automatic assault rifle developed in the Soviet Union by Mikhail Kalashnikov in 1947, but was not introduced into active service until 1948 where the fixed-stock version was sent in for production. In early 1949, the AK47 was accepted by the Soviet Armed Forces for mass deployment into front-line units. With a long-stroke gas piston, a selector/safety, an automated trigger and chambering mechanism, and further improvements to overall design the AK47 was a vast upgrade to the SKS. The AK47 would, for many years, be considered to be one of the world's most reliable and easy to maintain, handle, and learn weapons in the world."

 PDG_infantry_equipment_2_desc:0 "The AKM is a modernized variant of the AK47 that was developed by Mikhail Kalashnikov that was developed in the late 1950s and put into service with the Soviet Army in 1959. A great deal of the weapon was optimized and redesigned to suit the needs of the modernizing army. Many parts were simplified for mass production and the milled steel receiver was replaced with a u-shaped steel stamping to improve production rates. The weapon was also vastly lighter as a result of the simplifications reducing its weight. by ~30%. Additionally, the weapon was reinforced to make it stronger and added guide rails to improve the bolt carrier's movement. The AKM was immediately and ubiquitously used by many communist countries and manufactured for conflicts during its entire lifespan. Most notably the Invasion of Czechoslovakia, where it was used by both sides."

 PDG_infantry_equipment_3_short:0 "AK-74"
 PDG_infantry_equipment_3_desc:0 "The AK74 is a modern assault rifle developed by Mikhail Kalashnikov to replace the AKM in 1974. It uses a smaller cartridge and an improved chrome-lined bore with 4 right-hand grooves. The front sight and gas block were redesigned to contain a bas channel installed 90 degrees from the bore axis to reduce bullet shear at the port hold. In addition, its development came with a variety of attachments including a rubber padded stock. The AK74's improvements allowed soldiers to carry a greater amount of ammunition in the field and maintain a higher volume of fire at higher mid range accuracies. It saw expensive usage during the Afghanistan conflict where the CIA paid the Mujahideen a great sum of money to retrieve a captured AK74."

Designed as a patrol bomber, the Be-10 was notoriously difficult to fly, and suffered from metal fatigue due to stress from the airframe during high-speed takeoffs and landings as well as due to corrosion. As such the type was quickly replaced in service with the later Be-12 Mail. Known to the West as the Mallow, a modified civilian sub-variant, the M-10 was known to have established 12 world records by the Fédération aéronautique internationale (World Air Sports Federation) in 1961."

Unlike its immediate, turbojet-powered predecessor, the Be-12 was a turboprop powered aircraft, and also had retractable landing gear, which gave the craft an amphibious landing capability. The upgraded N variant came equipped with new sensors, avionics, a Nartsiss search and attack system and a Magnetic Anomaly Detector (MAD) sensor.
