 Tripura.1.t:0 "Tripura Merger Agreement"
 Tripura.1.d:0 "The State of Tripura was one of the ancient princely states of India. According to the Rajmala, Tripura was ruled continuously by as many as 184 Tripuri Kings with sovereign and independent status prior to its merger with the Indian Union in 1949, after the death of the last ruling King, Bir Bikram Kishore Debbarman. His successor, Kirit Bikram Kishore Deb Barman, was thirteen years old at the time of the merger. King Bir Bikram Kishore Debbarman had died in 1947, after which a Council of Regency was formed to run the administration under the presidency of Queen Kanchan Prava Devi, the mother of Kirit Bikram Kishore Deb Barman.\nWithin a few months after the unnatural demise of King Bir Bikram Kishore Debbarman, Tripura faced a great crisis, with threats from internal as well as external forces. Queen Kanchan Prava Devi, as president of the Council of Regency, came under severe pressure to opt to join the Indian Union. On the advice of the Government of India, she dissolved the Council of Regency and became the sole Regent on 12 January 1948. More than a year later she signed the 'Tripura Merger Agreement', and with effect Tripura became part of Indian Union. It was thereafter administered by the Chief Commissioner as a 'C' Category State."

 india.2.d:0 "India achieved independence from British Raj on 15 August 1947. The independence came through the Indian Independence Act 1947, an Act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom that partitioned British India into the two new independent Dominions of the British Commonwealth. India obtained its independence on 15 August 1947 as a constitutional monarchy with George VI as head of state and the Earl Mountbatten as governor-general.\nOn 29 August 1947, a Drafting Committee was appointed to draft a permanent constitution, with B. R. Ambedkar as chairman. A draft constitution was prepared by the committee and submitted to the Constituent Assembly. The Assembly met, in sessions open to public, for 166 days, spread over a period of two years before adopting the Constitution. After many deliberations and some modifications, the members of the Assembly signed two hand-written copies of the document."

Sablin_Meme.1.d:0 "Valery Sablin looked down at his feet in shame and disappointment as his supple yet firm fingers fondled his order of service of the motherland medal.\n\n"Fucking cocksucker. "How has my once proud workers' nation betrayed me? Was I not destine to be fucking Lenin reincarnated with a dash of Mother Teresa that a cultured proletarian could honor for all time?"\n\nSablin looked up from his court booth at his once brave seamen, still standing erect with dignity in front of the fat and tyrannical Brezhnev. Today of all days, the Soviet premier looked especially bloated as he read Sablin his sentence.\n\nBrezhnev began to finger each page of Sablins charges while adjusting his glasses.\n"Please have mercy on the poor boy" Suslov said from the gallows in a raspy yet commanding voice.\nBrezhnev dismissed the objections of the old revolutionary and continued.\n\n"By order of the supreme soviet, I hereby sentence you to death by firing squad." Brezhnev said with a stoic grunt that made Sablin shudder with both fear and to his surprise excitement.\n\n"Could I be martyred? What if my death causes the soviet people to band around me in solidarity as they shout my name? Sablin… Sablin…. Sablin… they will chant. They will all remember me now!" He thought as an excited yet childish grin filed his blushing face.\n\nBefore he could finish his thoughts, two powerful soviet officers in trimmed khaki shorts grabbed him by his warm body and dragged him outside in front of the Lenin's tomb. The taller officer kicked sablin to the ground and put his boot on the disgraced revolutionaries' throat. Despite the thick rubber, Sablin could feel each tendon in the officers foot flex. The officer then bent over to his ear.\n\n"You lived like Lenin, and now you shall die like Lenin" the officer whispered before a crack echoed throughout the Kremlin walls. As the sound faded, the world had realized, they had lost the greatest revolutionary to ever live."

Naxalbari.1.d:0 "Revolutionary Charu Majumdar has completed a series of documents to guide the ideological principles and revolutionary tactics of militant communist Naxalites. The documents denounce the Soviet Union as revisionist, condemns the Indian state, and calls for a peoples war to overthrow the government. The Naxalites are members of a more radical, splinter group who left the mainstream Indian Communist Party. They felt the ICP was compromised for participating in national politics and engaging with an Indian state Naxalites view as a bourgeois institution. The writings are already spreading across rural areas, especially in Bengal. There are already reports of peasants in the Naxalbari block of the Darjeeling District in Bengal beginning to agitate. The Indian government fears these documents may encourage widespread unrest."
Naxalbari.2.d:0 "Peasant committees, inspired by the writing of Cahru Majumdar recently formed in Darjeeling district and started seizing land from landlords and cultivating It without authority. Some of the effected landlords established armed groups who are targeting sharecroppers suspected of involvement in these committees. Militant peasants are seizing arms, food, and cash from landlords. Over the past few days reports have reached Calcutta that armed peasants are storming local government and police outposts, seizing documents related to land ownership and firearms. Efforts by local authorities to organize police bands failed to dislodge the peasants. The West Bengal government is calling the law and order situation out of control and are requesting the deployment of paramilitary forces to the region."
Naxalbari.3.d:0 "The situation in Darjeeling district continue to deteriorate as efforts at deploying armed police failed to disperse the Naxalite peasant militants. However, the tide started to change once paramilitary forces arrived on the scene. These heavily armed, trained soldiers easily drove off and disarmed a number of militants in the initial phases. The Indian government informed the media the deployment and operations would continue until law and order is restored. A statement by the communist rebels accused the Indian government of atrocities and deploying paid mercenaries to massacre innocent peasants. Overall, the general public appears more interested in restoring law and order than in listening to the demands of the Naxalites."
Naxalbari.4.d:0 "Following the deployment of paramilitary forces, the Naxalite movement appears to have gone underground. Most peasant committees and armed bands have turned in their weapons, while the most radical members appear to have retreated deeper in the jungle or melted into the villages. The Indian government is praising the successful operation and note that several of the more radical communist militants have either been killed or captured during ongoing operations. The Indian public is largely supportive of the government action as many regard the Naxalites as radicals and view their public statements as propaganda. The Prime Minister and military are concerned that once the operations end the rebels may just return so are said to be exploring options to negotiate with the local peasant leaders."
Naxalbari.5.d:0 "Peasant leaders in Darjeeling district announced they would halt armed operations against the Indian state and no longer support the Naxalites. The government claimed once the peasants understood how they were being exploited by the Naxalites, they immediately apologized and pledged to no longer be led astray. The peasant representatives claimed they remained loyal citizens of India and appreciated the effort of the government to restore order and also listen to the grievances of the peasants. The Indian government for its part said it appreciated the support of the peasants and planned on halting paramilitary operations in the region. The government added it would seek to address the concerns of peasants to help restore peace in the region. With this announcement, it appears the government has ended the peasant unrest but there are still concerns over the Naxalite leaders who did manage to escape underground in recent days."
Naxalbari.6.d:0 "The Naxalites have been a thorn on the side of the government for several years. The Prime Minister, taking advantage of the emergency situation, recently directed the Army to coordinate with local law enforcement for an all-out offensive against the group. Once the requisite forces were organized, Operation Steeplechase commenced. Indian troops, including paratroopers, paramilitary units, and police swept through Naxalite-controlled territory. Hundreds of Naxalites were neutralized and at least 20,000 suspected members are in custody. The operation is a resounding success, but the government is keeping details of it secret from the public to prevent public anxiety. The media is being informed not to report on the operation or face prosecution for compromising national security."
Naxalbari.7.d:0 "Charu Majumdar, a founder of the Naxalite movement and leading ideologue for the movement passed away while in custody in in Calcutta. Prison authorities claim he died of a massive heart attack. The police accompanied the body to the crematorium where the family met them. The police prevented the family from viewing the body before overseeing the cremation. The family and critics of the government claim Majumdar was likely killed under torture and are condemning the government for political murder. Majumdar published many notable works but will be remembered for his Eight Documents, which lay the ideological foundation of the Naxalite movement. The Naxalites released a statement promising to continue the struggle and seek justice for their leader."

SINO_INDIAN_WAR.0.d:0 "The border disputes between India and China have escalated in the years since 1947. India has accused China of encroaching on its territory in the North East Frontier Area (NEFA) and stealing Indian land by occupying in Aksai Chin. The Chinese in contrast claim all those territories are historically Chinese. They also accuse India of interfering in Nepal and Sikkim to preserve their own claims and interests. These tensions recently escalated after the Chinese government published a new map confirming its Aksai Chin occupation and claiming all of NEFA as its own. The Indian Prime Minister called an immediate meeting to determine how India will react to this threat. Some are calling for a diplomatic effort, and if that fails, a military deployment. Others are advocating for an immediate military deployment to demonstrate Indian resolve in the face of Chinese provocation."
SINO_INDIAN_WAR.1.d:0 "The Indian Army reported that Chinese patrols have crossed the McMahon Line and setup outposts in strategic areas in NEFA. The recent publishing of controversial maps combined with these incursions are causing intelligence officials to conclude China maybe planning to seize NEFA from us. The Indian media is condemning the government and calling for a much tougher line on China. Our forces are monitoring the Chinese and it appears they are holding at the moment. We should decide quickly how to confront the Chinese provocation, whether through diplomatic or military means."
SINO_INDIAN_WAR.2.d:0 "The Indian government has issued loud and public denunciation of our recent maps, accusing us of occupying Indian land and claiming their territory. The Indian claims run counter to the historical facts and are based on British imperialist propaganda. We believe the Indians are either trying to save face with their public or are harboring dangerous ambitions against China. We recently received an invitation to hold formal talks regarding the disputed borders with India. Although we are just in our claims, it may prove fruitful to hear out the Indians and understand their ambitions. Senior officials argue we should attend the talks. Others in the government argue we should just decline to show India we will not be bullied."
SINO_INDIAN_WAR.3.d:0 "Senior Chinese leaders met with their Indian counterparts to hold talks over their disputed borders. The talks came following a diplomatic escalation caused by the publication of maps by the Chinese government that India claims placed its territory under Chinese rule. In particular the Indian government believes China is encroaching past boundaries negotiated by China and the British Indian colonial government and in the case of Aksai Chin, considered part of Jammu and Kashmir by India, they have simply seized Indian land. China in contrast claims it is occupying historically Chinese territory and India does not have exclusive claims to Aksai Chin due to the disputed nature of Kashmir. Analysts are unsure if India can achieve its goals as China is largely firmly in control of the disputed territories."
SINO_INDIAN_WAR.4.d:0 "India has started off our discussions on border disputes by calling for a Chinese withdrawal from Aksai Chin. The Indians claim the territory is historically a part of Jammu and Kashmir and since the Princely ruler acceded the state to India, that land belongs to them. Our own diplomats noted India had no presence in that territory, either in terms of personnel or citizens, and it was our government which established roads to link the area to China. Furthermore, Kashmir is a territory of international dispute and India does not have exclusive claims. We have no intention of giving up Aksai Chin, it is far too important for us strategically and we have invested heavily there. However, we will offer India a deal, they must accept our claim to Aksai Chin, and we will withdraw our own claims to the territory they call the North East Frontier Area."
SINO_INDIAN_WAR.5.d:0 "The Chinese government has offered an agreement to end their claims to the North East Frontier Area (NEFA) in exchange for us recognizing their occupation of Aksai Chin. The proposal essentially calls for the current borders to be made permanent and end the dispute. China definitely ends up winning the most though having an established border could reduce the security pressure on India. However, senior advisors warn the agreement will be seen as a defeat for India and we should make a counteroffer. After deliberation it was decided that we will ask China to also confirm its recognition of the borders of Nepal, Bhutan, and Sikkim. Furthermore, China must acknowledge India as the patron power of Sikkim. If China agrees to this, then a deal can certainly be reached. We can also reject this clearly biased solution from the Chinese and recognize they were never serious about negotiations."
SINO_INDIAN_WAR.6.d:0 "The Indian government has sent a counteroffer to us. For them to accept our claims to Aksai Chin and make the current border at NEFA permanent, they need us to confirm the current borders of Bhutan, Sikkim, and Nepal. Furthermore, they want us to recognize Sikkim as a part of the Indian sphere of influence. Accepting this would greatly hinder future diplomatic flexibility in the Himalayas but at least our claims would no longer face criticisms from India. If that is important to us, we must accept the agreement. If not, we can end the talks. We already control Aksai Chin and much of our claims to NEFA so a failure to sign an agreement would not be a disaster for our government."
SINO_INDIAN_WAR.7.d:0 "Despite widespread skepticism from experts, the leaders of China and India signed a comprehensive agreement to resolve their border dispute. In the final agreement, India must accept Chinese control of Aksai Chin and their current boundary in the disputed NEFA border area. In exchange the Chinese must also accept the current boundary in NEFA and end its claims to the whole territory from India. Furthermore, China has agreed to accept the current borders of Sikkim, Nepal, and Bhutan, using boundaries established by the former British colonial government of India. The agreement appears to be a true compromise. Chinese control of Aksai Chin is legitimized while India has firmly established its influence among the Himalayan states."
SINO_INDIAN_WAR.8.d:0 "Hopes that India could negotiate a resolution to their border disputes with China have ended in failure. The Chinese government is being accused by Indian officials and newspapers of harboring hostile territorial designs on India. One particularly scathing editorial noted the Chinese had seized Indian lands since 1947 and when India sought to hold talks to peacefully try and end this aggression, the Chinese proved uncooperative and satisfied with their theft. There are growing calls for the government to take a much stronger approach by deploying troops on the border. In China, the response was largely muted, with senior officials and state media stating that China has no imperialist ambitions and will not be bullied to handing over historically Chinese territory by India. In at least one report a senior Chinese official pointed out that India should be thankful China does not forcibly evict them from the Chinese territory they continue to occupy."
SINO_INDIAN_WAR.9.d:0 "Following reports that the Chinese were slowly deploying troops in NEFA, a high-level meeting was called by the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister heard from senior defence officials and military leaders about plans to implement the Forward Policy strategy against Chinese infiltrators. Forward Policy calls for Indian troops to establish posts behind Chinese forces to cut them off from their supplies and force their withdrawal. General B.M. Kaul, a leading advocate for the strategy insists Forward Policy is defensive and will result in Chinese withdrawals, with little risk of casualties. He assessed the Chinese military as being largely of militia quality. Some senior generals voiced concerns over escalating the conflict and leaving Indian forces isolated in forward posts, but in the end the Prime Minister approved the plan for implementing Forward Policy in NEFA."
SINO_INDIAN_WAR.10.d:0 "The Forward Policy has so far led to success along the McMahon Line. Most of the Chinese incursions have withdrawn back across the line. The Indian Army is ecstatic with the results and they now proposed a plan to establish posts north of the McMahon Line and solidify our claims to the area. Many officers believe the operations prove the hypothesis that Chinese forces lack modern military standards. However, some of the other senior generals are urging caution, stating we have stabilized the borders and should not press an experienced Chinese military. The Prime Minister must decide whether he wants to move forward to finally end the threat of Chinese incursions."
SINO_INDIAN_WAR.11.d:0 "The Indian Army has established a series of posts in our territory north of the McMahon Line. The Indians had claimed the McMahon Line marked our border but this incursion clearly shows they have hostile intentions. Our own forces are worried that from these posts the Indians will soon interdict the movement of reinforcements and supplies. However, these posts are largely isolated and if we move adequate forces, they can use infiltration tactics to drive the Indians back. The decision is ours, should we drive off the Indians or let them push us back and make a new defensive line."
SINO_INDIAN_WAR.12.d:0 "The Indian government announced its forces had asserted its position in NEFA and had neutralized the Chinese threat to its territory. The Indian Army in its own statement praised the professionalism of its forces in carrying out difficult operations. The Chinese government has not released any public statements, but its diplomats are said to be criticizing India for its hostile action. It appears the Chinese government were not willing to fight for this territory. A Chinese delegation was said to have flown to Delhi for emergency talks."
SINO_INDIAN_WAR.13.d:0 "A Chinese delegation arrived in Delhi to hold emergency talks with the Prime Minister over the recent violence along the border in NEFA. The Chinese are asking for us to withdraw to the pre-war McMahon Line border. They promised if we accept, they will ensure their forces no longer carry out incursions and respect the line. They suggested a refusal may cause China to act. The proposal appears reasonable as we have long called for the McMahon Line to be accepted as the border. However, we currently have the advantage and it may be foolish to let it go."
SINO_INDIAN_WAR.14.d:0 "The Indian government has shown their imperialistic ambitions by refusing to restore the borders. Despite our call for restoring peace, the Indians instead are now occupying Chinese lands they claimed to have no interest in previously. The PLA is ready for action and is ready to move in if ordered. We must decide if we want to launch an offensive to evict the Indians or if we should just let the situation remain. The people of China are feeling humiliated, perhaps now is the time to act and restore order."
SINO_INDIAN_WAR.15.d:0 "The Indian government was stunned to receive news of Chinese troops attacking Indian outposts all along our positions in NEFA. The Chinese government claimed the PLA is moving in to restore order and stability in the area. The Indian Army, although surprised, promises their forces are more than capable to meet the threat. The Chinese government also stated its operations were meant to teach India a lesson on humility. The Indian government in contrast has condemned the Chinese action, calling it a continuation of its hostile actions since independence."
SINO_INDIAN_WAR.16.d:0 "The Indians and Chinese are currently embroiled in an armed conflict. Many in the GHQ believe this presents an opportunity for Pakistan to make gains in Kashmir. The conflict has caught our intelligence and military off-guard, many of our forces are currently on leave. However, if we give the order now, we can try to push from Haji Pir and Burzil and seize territory north of Srinagar. This advance will immensely improve our position in Kashmir but not provoke the Indians or international community to the point of overt condemnation. However, if the attack fails we may take unforeseen losses. We must make the decision to deploy the military or not."
SINO_INDIAN_WAR.17.d:0 "The Indian military reported to the Prime Minister that Indian forces had launched a limited offensive in Kashmir. Early intelligence and reconnaissance reports indicate this is not the beginning of a full-on invasion but appears to be an opportunistic attempt to make border gains while we are fighting China. We are already reaching out to the major powers to protest this Pakistani aggression, but it appears they will not likely do much considering its limited scope. Regardless, our forces will respond and punish the Pakistanis for this treachery. However, we must be sure that we do not forget the Chinese threat. The people must rally to the nation."
SINO_INDIAN_WAR.18.d:0 "The fighting in Kashmir died down in recent hours. Recent reports indicate a new ceasefire is in place and it appears Pakistan now occupies strategic territory north of Srinagar. Jubilant crowds are said to be gathering in major cities across Pakistan following an announcement by the government that some Kashmiri lands had been liberated. The Indian government has tried to remain quiet so far, however, it is clear from private statements that a setback had occurred in Kashmir. Analysts note Pakistan likely improved its position along the border, but it is not likely that they seized huge amounts of lands as that would have provoked a general war and international condemnation. Many Indian newspapers are condemning Pakistan for backstabbing them as they fight the massive communist Chinese invasion."
SINO_INDIAN_WAR.19.d:0 "The recent Pakistani offensive against Indian forces in northern Kashmir ended in failure. Pakistan had hoped to take advantage of the Sino-Indian conflict by making gains in Kashmir. Pakistan hoped to establish a new position that would enable it to better liberate Kashmir in the future. Instead, the Pakistani offensive not only failed but saw Indian forces advance and capture the strategic Burzil Pass. With Burzil Pass under Indian control, they are now in a position to threaten Skardu. The Pakistan government conceded an unprovoked Indian offensive had made minor gains but Pakistani forces prevented further losses. Analysts believes the Pakistani military may have rushed into battle hoping to achieve surprise but this ended up backfiring for them. There are reports of angry Pakistani crowds assembling, while the Indian media is full of praise for the armed forces."
SINO_INDIAN_WAR.20.d:0 "The Indian government declared its forces had cleared invading Chinese troops and established a new line north of the McMahon Line. India argues it acted only after years of Chinese provocations. The Chinese government was quick to condemn India for its aggression against the Chinese people and claimed their forces had simply been caught off guard and not defeated in combat. The Indian Army is said to be ecstatic with its recent performance in not just repelling the Chinese assault but also pushing them back. While the Chinese government is underplaying the extent of the fighting, privately many analysts believes Beijing will likely conduct an extensive evaluation of its military forces. India must decide if it wants to permanently occupy the land it has gained, risking a general war with China, return the land for security guarantees, or press its advantage and advance deeper into Chinese territory."
SINO_INDIAN_WAR.21.d:0 "Following our recent clashes with an aggressive and cunningly prepared Indian military, they occupied lands beyond what they originally claimed. They are calling it the natural frontier of their territory called the North East Frontier Agency (NEFA). Intelligence reports Indian troops are digging in and establishing permanent construction sites. We must decide how to act, either we accept the Indian gains and re-establish a ceasefire line, or we expand the conflict and start a general war to drive the Indians out of these lands." 
SINO_INDIAN_WAR.22.d:0 "The Indian government dispatched a senior diplomat to privately deliver a message. If we would accept the pre-conflict McMahon Line as the permanent border and publicly withdraw our claims to lands south of the so-called McMahon Line. The proposal appeared reasonable and our government accepted, though a further demand we withdraw from Aksai Chin was rejected. Over the next few days the Indian Army withdrew its forces as our troops returned to the area. Our commanders are under strict instructions to obey the established pre-conflict line as the Indians made it clear a failure to do so could result in a fresh attack. The Indians are gloating over their success while we must figure out what went wrong."
SINO_INDIAN_WAR.23.d:0 "The Indian Prime Minister lauded the people of India and the armed forces for their steadfast bravery in the face of massive Chinese aggression on the border. Painting a dire picture, the Prime Minister noted the Chinese were only miles from reaching the plains of India and ravaging the nation before the Indian military defeated them. The remarks came following reports that India successfully repulsed a Chinese offensive along their disputed border in the North East Frontier Agency. The Chinese government downplayed the recent setbacks, accusing India of being the aggressor and grossly exaggerating the extent of the fighting. The Chinese media is portraying the fighting as a minor skirmish, but analysts believe the truth lies between the two stories being portrayed."
SINO_INDIAN_WAR.24.d:0 "The PLA has successfully driven the Indian troops occupying our lands back and have even pushed deep into NEFA. Some reports are calling the Indian defeat disastrous and claim China has basically completely occupied NEFA. These reports are not that far off, our forces will soon control NEFA and are poised to inflict a devastating blow to India proper. However, doing so may provoke an international intervention and our commanders are not sure if we have the logistical capacity to invade such a large nation. We can either press on and open up the conflict, claim NEFA and risk India expanding the conflict, or simply announce a ceasefire and return to what we see as the pre-war borders to maximize the psychological, diplomatic, and military success of our forces."
SINO_INDIAN_WAR.25.d:0 "Sikkim has long been a puppet to the Indian government. Its people are controlled by a puppet prince placed there by British imperialists and maintained by the Indian successor state. The territory offers India a ledge to spy on us and its status as a "independent" state makes it a perfect buffer for them. With our conflict in India heating up, it may be in our interests to no longer accept the myth of Sikkim and its artificial borders. The PLA is ready to move in and liberate its people from local tyranny and Indian hegemony. However, the choice on what to do with Sikkim ultimately lies with the Chairman and Politburo."
SINO_INDIAN_WAR.26.d:0 "Following our reversals in the recent border conflict with China, we have lost the North East Frontier Agency. The Chinese attacked with overwhelming and lethal power, catching our forces off guard to seize the lands. Intelligence reports indicate the Chinese are currently digging in the territory and are moving materials to establish permanent structures to solidify their claims. The Indian military admits it was it took a hit in the recent conflict, but if called upon it will strike back. We can order the military to escalate the conflict and launch an all-out attack to drive back the invaders, or we can leave the situation as is and let this fighting come to an end."
SINO_INDIAN_WAR.27.d:0 "The Chinese government announced a ceasefire and have withdrawn its forces to the pre-conflict border with India along the so-called McMahon Line. This news has stunned the Indian government which had recently begun a desperate call for help to deal with what it termed to be Chinese aggression. The Chinese government insisted its forces acted defensively and as China was not an imperial power, it had no desire to invade or occupy any other nation. Analysts suggest the Chinese actions mark a diplomatic and military victory. By not seizing lands, China undermined the Indian argument that it faced a massive invasion from China. In addition by publicly showing it was their forces who were withdrawing under no threat from India, it highlights the thoroughness of their military successes in the conflict. Already the Indian media is publishing critical articles and sources indicate the Indian government plans on doing a lot of soul searching."
SINO_INDIAN_WAR.28.d:0 "The recent conflict between India and China alongside their disputed border in the North East Frontier Agency ended in a Chinese military victory. The Indian military proved incapable of the task and are being seen as poorly equipped and led during the conflict. Many Indians believe this failure to supply and lead highly motivated and trained soldiers is a result of complacency and lingering colonial influences on the institution. For China, the military victory is seen as confirmation that the PLA is capable of not only waging massive wars but also handle localized threats to its borders. Many now suggest the fighting in India offers a blueprint that can be used in other difficult border areas. Chinese leaders are thrilled by the successful coordination of diplomatic, military, and political power to achieve success."
SINO_INDIAN_WAR.29.d:0 "The Indian government has sent out a desperate plea, calling for extensive military aid to strengthen the Indian military as it faces the threat of communist China. Intelligence reports warn a communist advance in India could provoke the Indian communists to abandon the government and break Indian unity. They suggest we should provide military aid, especially for mountain warfare units to help bolster their defenses and help them prevent a deep communist penetration. Although it appears natural we should aid India against a communist foe, some in the administration warn the Indian government has historically been cold to the West. In addition, providing such aid would provoke an angry response from Pakistan. We must decide how to act."
SINO_INDIAN_WAR.30.d:0 "Emergency equipment of western arms have arrived to aid the Indian Army in its defence against China. Although our government requested a much larger aid package and called for western bombers to target the Chinese, this support will improve our capabilities. The Defence Ministry will oversee the integration of such equipment to our forces and we have sent a message of gratitude to the United States. Pakistan is furious over the decision, but this is no matter, India needs this support to defend itself. Indian communist activists are also condemning this action, but we informed the public our acceptance of such aid does not indicate we have joined the Western camp."
SINO_INDIAN_WAR.31.d:0 "With the conflict between India and China escalating into a full-on war, there may be an opportunity for us. We can mobilize our forces and attack India as they are no doubt distracted by this conflict. Many advocate that a strong strike can secure Kashmir and perhaps resolve some of the lingering territorial issues from Partition. There are already some in the country calling for the government to act in this golden opportunity. However, others in the government are urging caution. They fear if we join the war we may become internationally isolated and lose key UN support for Kashmir."
SINO_INDIAN_WAR.32.d:0 "The American Ambassador called on the President for a private discussion. The ambassador gave a dire warning that the United States was aware of our plans to join the war against India. He added if such an action was taken the United States would halt all military and economic aid. It would also pressure its allies to cut off its own support, which would essentially cripple our economy and severely weaken the military. The United States cannot tolerate one of its regional allies joining a communist nation in a war of aggression. After giving this warning, the President called an emergency cabinet meeting. After a brief discussion, it was decided that current plans to join the war will be shelved."
SINO_INDIAN_WAR.33.d:0 "In a rare act of cooperation, the United States and Soviet Union have both brought intense pressure, either indirectly or directly to China and India. They are pressuring the two sides to quickly end the current fighting and return peace to the region. So far both governments are resisting the superpower pressure. However, there is wider international concern regarding the potential humanitarian or wider geopolitical consequence of the war if it lasts too long. Privately, the leaders of China and India are informing their commanders that they must achieve results as soon as possible."
SINO_INDIAN_WAR.34.d:0 "The United Nations announced a ceasefire between China and India has come into effect. The recent conflict escalated following a series of border clashes along the McMahon Line in the eastern Himalayas. This border conflict escalated into a general war, but the international community quickly put heavy pressure for the fighting to end. There was fear regarding the humanitarian costs of having the two largest populations engaged in an all-out war with one another. The coming days will the final results from the conflict."
SINO_INDIAN_WAR.35.d:0 "Following a UN ceasefire, it is clear that India has dominated the former McMahon Line. Chinese troops have largely been driven out and the Indian government claims it will maintain control in order to protect the North East Frontier Area from future Chinese aggression. The Chinese government released a brief statement condemning Indian militarism and imperialist ambitions. Beijing had long claimed the territory, including all of NEFA as its own, but following this setback, it must contend with Indian control of the area."
SINO_INDIAN_WAR.36.d:0 "India had vehemently condemned the Chinese occupation of Aksai Chin when it discovered China built highways connecting the region to China. India argued the land was historically part of Kashmir and thus under Indian control. China disagreed, claiming the land as historically Chinese and noting that Kashmir was disputed, negating any Indian claims of complete authority. During the cent conflict, the Indian military managed to successfully dislodge Chinese forces and occupy Aksai Chin for the first time in Indian history. With the ceasefire in effect, the Indian government announced it had liberated Kashmiri land and removed one of the foreign occupiers of the former princely state. It added that complete liberation would be a matter of time. This last statement angered Pakistani leaders who issued a protest statement. Observers note with its victory in Aksai Chin, Pakistan is now more diplomatically isolated with regards to Kashmir and China has lost a key connection between its main lands and Xinjiang."
SINO_INDIAN_WAR.37.d:0 "In a major setback for China, the victorious Indian government announced the establishment of a new provisional government of Tibet following a UN ceasefire which ended their recent conflict. The new government in Lhasa is to facilitate the return of an independent Tibetan state. The successful advance of Indian forces pushed the Chinese to the point that their presence in Tibet appears increasingly untenable. Many Western states were quick to praise this decision and the Dalai Lama is said to be preparing for his return to Lhasa. The Chinese government is condemning the installing of a puppet regime and privately there is a fear that Tibet may become lost permanently. In Lhasa, there are reports of civilians celebrating as Indian troops look on, providing security for the festive atmosphere."
SINO_INDIAN_WAR.38.d:0 "Following the ending of fighting between China and India following a UN brokered ceasefire, the Chinese announced it was in full possession of its rightful claims along its eastern border. The Indian government has remained mute, but privately some officials have admitted the Chinese are in full control of not just the McMahon Line but also all of the North East Frontier Agency. The lack of Indian reaction and the immense international pressure which brought a ceasefire indicates India will likely have to accept the territorial setback."
SINO_INDIAN_WAR.39.d:0 "The end of fighting between India and China saw Chinese forces overrun much of Indian Kashmir. The Chinese are being met as liberators by some Kashmiris, with Chinese troops being greeted by homemade Kashmiri, Pakistani, and Chinese flags. This has recently led to embarrassing propaganda photos and incidents of Pakistani officers acting as "observers" visiting Kashmiri leaders. The Chinese government upped the ante by declaring they will soon withdraw from Kashmir but under the condition that India enforces UN resolutions on Kashmir and hold a plebiscite. The alternative is China continuing to occupy Kashmir or, more likely, hand the territory over to Pakistan. The Indian government is expected to soon announce its intention to hold plebiscite, which will trigger a Chinese withdrawal and a new future for Kashmir."
SINO_INDIAN_WAR.40.d:0 "During the recent conflict between India and China, the PLA managed to capture Sikkim. The Chinese portrayed the conquest as a liberation from a corrupt, Indian-backed puppet regime. The Indian government called it a naked land grab and called on the people of Sikkim to stay strong during their difficult time. Regardless, the Chinese remain firmly in control of Sikkim and the Chinese are already announcing plans to integrate the former princely state along the lines of what the government did in Tibet. The former royal family of Sikkim has fled to Delhi and are holding press conferences with Indian and global media."
SINO_INDIAN_WAR.41.d:0 "The Chinese government formally handed power to a new independent Kashmiri government in Srinagar. The Chinese claimed the Kashmiri people for years remained under the autocratic rule of a British-backed monarch, only to then be the victims of Indian and Pakistani imperialism. The new Kashmiri government released its own statement claiming for the first time since 1947, all of Kashmir was under one government. It added that for the first time in its history, the province would be under the control of the Kashmiri people. This is the latest blow to Pakistan and India following their military defeat against China. The new Kashmiri state provides China a strategic buffer and greatly weaken the geopolitical positioning of the defeated states. India and Pakistan both released statements expressing their disappointment to these developments."

CMC_Sino_India_War.260.d:0 "The Chinese government capitulated to international pressure to halt its war against India. An international coalition, including the United States and Soviet Union recently formed in response to an escalating Chinese invasion of India. The powerful anti-Chinese coalition is called for China to halt its war and restore Indian territory. The Indian government welcomed the news, calling it a victory for peace and its steadfast support for international cooperation. The Chinese are said to be bitter with the news. Leading publications are calling the coalition a neo-imperialist plot meant to hold China back."

India_Pak_War_65.1.d:0 "We will soon approach the UN to arrange a ceasefire to end the current war against Pakistan. Our senior officials and military leaders suggest continuing the conflict will not greatly change the current situation on the ground. Our people and military have fought with immense bravery and discipline. The Pakistani aggression has been met by our strongest resistance and we cannot expect more. It is now our duty to bring the conflict to a conclusion and end the fighting."
India_Pak_War_65.2.d:0 "Our armed forces gave a befitting reply to the recent aggression by Pakistan. The result of their folly is clear for the world to see. However, a never-ending conflict and arms race in South Asia is not the destiny our founders envisioned for the Indian Union. Now that we have the upper hand, it is a moment for us to reach out and offer brotherly ties with Pakistan. This would also allow us to confirm the new political order in South Asia. Internationally, such an approach will be widely appreciated."
India_Pak_War_65.3.d:0 "The Indian government formally requested talks with our government. The Indians claim they wish to reset relations and end the years of animosity since Partition. It is likely the Indians want to normalize relations and establish stronger trade ties. Some of our advisors feel this may help out our economy which is reeling from the recent war and losses. In addition, this could build support among the liberal elements of society. However, India is likely capitalizing on their recent military success and to engage them may be seen as acknowledging our weak position. It may be better for the morale of our people to reject this initiative and focus on our efforts to rebuild. We must decide how to respond."
India_Pak_War_65.4.d:0 "During our talks with India, they have proposed a complete normalization of relations along with an agreement to ease immigration restrictions. The agreement would improve relations, especially trade ties. Our own population would likely support the easing of immigration, this would allow the reunion of families and friends long separated by Partition and offer opportunity for some citizens to reclaim lost properties. However, there is some resistance, especially among senior military officers who believe the best approach would be to walk away from the talks and end the talks. This would assert Pakistani defiance. We must decide how to respond."
India_Pak_War_65.5.d:0 "Our recent effort to normalize relations with Pakistan has ended in success. The Pakistanis agreed to sign a range of agreements which will improve trade, normalize relations, and ease immigration restrictions. News of the agreement is already being positively received domestically and internationally. The world now sees India is a new type of power. Indians and Pakistanis can now become like the brothers and sisters they were meant to be. We are not a militarist power or imperialistic, instead we are a peace-loving nation devoted to continuous peace."
India_Pak_War_65.6.d:0 "The Indian effort at normalizing ties with Pakistan ended in embarrassing failure. The Pakistanis condemned the Indians for seeking to cement their recent successes and turn Pakistan into an Indian puppet. The Pakistan government released a further statement claiming they will never give up on their desire to liberate the people of Kashmir and prevent India from becoming a hegemonic power in South Asia. The Indian government responded by saying Pakistan was politicizing a genuine effort at peace and they had only revealed their desire for war."
India_Pak_War_65.7.d:0 "The military setbacks in our recent war with Pakistan has revealed systemic problems. Parliament, shortly after the conflict ended, established a commission to study these military deficiencies and develop solutions. Their conclusions have been submitted to the Prime Minister who must decide on which recommendation to implement. The Prime Minister must thread carefully as too drastic of an action could break the institutional health of the military. The committee ultimately blamed the backwards colonial heritage inherited from the British. This has led to a recruitment policy which excludes large parts of the population. In addition, this has caused a number of senior officers who reached their ranks largely due to their service in the colonial British Indian Army. One solution is to institute reforms in recruiting, which would allow us to more effectively use our immense manpower. The other solution is to sack a number of Army officers and pave the way for more creative, professional officers to rise. We must decide what reform is most important as doing both could prove catastrophic."
India_Pak_War_65.8.d:0 "After releasing the committee report on recent military failures, the Prime Minister decided to act. He has announced the sacking of a large number of senior officers, especially Brigadiers, Major Generals, Lt Generals, and Generals. This will pave the way for younger officers to rise. The military response has been mute, but privately many officers are said to be fuming. Regardless, the public is largely supportive of the actions, viewing it as a necessary action. This is no doubt an incredibly difficult day for India, but without these actions, India cannot have the rebirth necessary to overcome its recent setbacks."
India_Pak_War_65.9.d:0 "The Indian government announced a series of reforms meant to widen the base of recruitment and better connect the military to the people of India. The government added it is following recommendations recently made by the parliamentary committee investigating recent military failures. Many Indians strongly support the decision as many felt the military continues to cling onto colonial practices with regards to its recruiting and organization. The new reforms will expand the base of recruitment and establish more training programs to civilian education institutions. The Indian government added these reforms will help the nation maximize its vast population and resources to better ensure the defence and honor of India."

Jammue_Refugee_Crisis.1.d:0 "The Pakistan insistence of seizing Kashmir has seen the largest refugee crisis since partition. Hindu Kashmiris are streaming into Punjab. There are reports that emboldened Kashmiri Muslims are forcibly seizing properties and threatening the Hindu community. The refugees are being placed in temporary camps before they can be rehabilitated. The arrival of refugees is raising anger and communal spirits. The local authorities are deploying extra police to prevent violence. Their presence is also renewing criticism of the government for its performance in the war."
IND_BAN.22.d:0 "Our failed offensive in East Pakistan has provoked open revolt and rioting by Bengali refugees and their supporters in Calcutta. The reaction is driven by genuine despair and the pressures caused by the massive influx in refugees since the crisis began. The local authorities requested support from local Army units to keep the peace. Many shops and buildings were damaged in the violence, with local reports calling it the worst violence since Partition. There are now calls from residents for the government to deport the refugees. We will have to deal with tensions in Bengal for the foreseeable future."

IND_BENGAL.1.d:0 "The Pakistan Army recently launched a crackdown in East Pakistan. Their brutal violence has escalated the situation and resulted in a growing refugee crisis. Pakistanis, especially Hindus, are fleeing to Calcutta from East Pakistan. They are bringing stories of atrocities and brutal repression. The international media is covering the situation while local authorities are setting up emergency refugee camps. Reports from the border suggest the number of refugees will likely reach the millions. The federal government will step in to help local authorities. Considering the number of refugees and the resources we will require to host them we can expect the economy to be negatively impacted. There are also fears that tensions will rise between our population and the refugees. Regardless, the people of India must rise to the occasion and help the Bengalis suffering under military repression."
IND_BENGAL.2.d:0 "The Indian government formally requested we act to help resolve the situation in East Pakistan. The Indians are pointing to the rising refugee crisis in Calcutta and the widely reported news of a brutal Pakistani military crackdown. The Indians suggest if a solution cannot be found, they may be forced to act and resolve the situation themselves. We have historically close ties with Pakistan and the State Department suggests we can put pressure on them. Our national media is widely reporting on the Pakistani crackdown and there is growing agitation for us to act and end the violence. However, the Pakistanis would likely view any effort by us negatively and it is generally not our policy to not intervene in the internal affairs of friendly states at the behest of other states."
IND_BENGAL.3.d:0 "The United States recently dispatched a diplomatic delegation to Pakistan and urged its government to halt its ongoing military operations in East Pakistan. The Pakistani government publicly stated it appreciated American interest but privately reports indicate they are furious. The American effort is not likely to cause Pakistan to change its approach to the situation, but it indicates the rising international isolation Pakistan is facing with its ongoing operations. The Indian government released a statement in support of the American effort, fueling media reports in Pakistan accusing America and India colluding against the nation."
IND_BENGAL.4.d:0 "The Indian government recently dispatched an emergency delegation to hold talks with us over the ongoing crisis in East Pakistan. The Indians expressed fears that if the situation deteriorated further it could lead to catastrophe across the region. They urged us to implement the Ahsan Formula as the best solution to end the crisis in a peaceful and honorable way. This was done privately as the Indians did not want to make it seem like they were forcing our hand and to give us political cover, which is appreciated. Senior military leaders and hawks are urging the President to reject what they see is Indian hegemony. However, some cabinet members believe the Ahsan Formula remains the best solution and we should implement it as soon as possible."
IND_BENGAL.5.d:0 "We received a troubling ultimatum from the Indian government calling for us to immediately halt military operations and withdraw from so-called Bangladesh. The Indians call the operations a humanitarian crisis and incubator of human rights abuses that will boil over and lead to catastrophe across the region. They are giving us three months to implement the withdrawal, stating that a failure to do so may result in India taking whatever actions are necessary to end the violence. There are many who feel India is just blustering and have no intention of involving themselves militarily. Some other leaders believe even if India intervenes, the Pakistan nation is more than ready to offer a befitting reply. Privately, a few officials are urging the President to accept the ultimatum and cut our losses in East Pakistan. They say the sting of a withdrawal is much preferred to what they fear may end up being a military disaster."

INDIA_KAS60s.0.d:0 "Several days ago, Srinagar erupted in mass protests following reports that a Holy Relic was stolen from the famed Hazratbal Shrine. Kashmiri Muslims immediately took to the streets to condemn the theft and the protests soon evolved into anti-Indian agitation. Communal tensions in Kashmir are heating up as rumors that the Hindu community organized the theft spread among Kashmiri Muslims. The Indian government was caught off guard by these protests and are scrambling how to respond. Local authorities are concerned and want to deploy police with troops to quell the unrest. However, members of the cabinet and central government feel such a strong-armed approach may enflame tensions. Instead they suggest the government call for a complete investigation and express understanding to the unrest."
INDIA_KAS60s.1.d:0 "Several weeks after the Indian government announced it was deploying its top investigative unit, the Central Bureau of Investigation, to find the stolen relic in Kashmir, it was recovered yesterday. The Indian and Kashmiri government have not explained how the relic was recovered, but expressed satisfaction. Hindu temples and Masjids held prayers of thanks to help reduce the communal tensions in the region. Many Kashmiris, especially those connected with the government are satisfied with the results, but there is lingering animosity towards the Indian government over its failure to end the political limbo Kashmir remains in. Among more anti-Indian Kashmiris, they are spreading rumors that the relic recovered was a forgery created by the government."
INDIA_KAS60s.2.d:0 "In response to the theft of a Muslim holy relic in Srinagar, Kashmiri Muslims began agitating in frustration to the theft but also continued Indian rule over the Kashmir Valley. Many are expressing anger over the political limbo Kashmiris have lived under since 1947. Communal tensions also rose as rumors of Hindu involvement with the theft and their perceived closeness to the Indian government. In response to the unrest, the Indian government deployed troops along with armed police. This heavy-handed approach ended up enflaming tensions as Muslims noticed troops deployed to protect Hindu temples, enflaming the communal and political unrest. The holy relic was recovered yesterday, but hopes that this would immediately end the protests were dashed as Kashmiris in Srinagar continue to agitate against their current political impasse."
INDIA_KAS60s.3.d:0 "Over the past several months, Indian soldiers and police have detained agitators across Kashmir. These men were identified by the government as being ringleaders involved in sowing discontent and communal tensions in the province. Although the number of protests had decreased following the recovery of the stolen holy relic, this latest wave of arrest has sparked a new round of demonstrations. Many Kashmiri political leaders are now criticizing the Indian government for using force instead of dialogue during a period of heightened tensions. The media across India is widely supporting this tough line to what the government has portrayed as general lawlessness."
INDIA_KAS60s.4.d:0 "Following the recent tensions in Kashmir, the Indian government realized the Kashmiri people were increasingly frustrated over the current situation. As part of efforts to rectify this, the Indian government announced it would release famed Kashmiri political leader Sheikh Abdullah. The former Prime Minister of Jammu and Kashmir had been serving a long-term prison sentence for allegedly plotting against India to establish an independent Kashmir state. Upon his release Sheikh Abdullah pledged he would work with the Indian government and ensure the rights and wishes of the Kashmiri people are always satisfied. This action will help alleviate some of the frustrations among Kashmiris who welcome the return of a man called the Sher-e-Kashmir (Lion of Kashmir)."
INDIA_KAS60s.5.d:0 "The recent religious and political upheaval has caused major communal disturbances in East Pakistan and West Bengal. In East Pakistan, demonstrators condemned what they perceived was an attack on Islam and the continued repression of Kashmiri Muslims by the Indian state. These demonstrations turned into communal riots when protestors began attacking Hindu neighborhoods. When people in West Bengal heard of these attacks, they started their own demonstrations and targeted Muslim neighborhoods, causing riots to breakout. The scale of the violence is nowhere near the communal riots of Partition, however, many in India fear further incidents could escalate the situation. Bengal is currently calm, but the communal tensions between Hindus and Muslims is heightened."
INDIA_KAS60s.6.d:0 "The Parliament is debating whether to invoke Articles 356 and 357 to Jammu and Kashmir. This would suspend the state government and allow the center to impose direct rule over the province, allowing it to assume legislative authority. Imposing State Rule will enable the government to amend the state constitution in Kashmir and gut some of the autonomy granted through Article 370 and make the state more inline with the Indian Constitution. Considering the recent unrest in Kashmir, many in India believe this action is essential to preventing either a Kashmiri or Pakistani plot to undermine Indian rule. Many of the leading Kashmiri politicians, even pro-Indian ones are arguing vehemently against this action and argue such a move would be seen as a betrayal by Kashmiris and cement their animosity to India."
INDIA_KAS60s.7.d:0 "The Indian parliament voted to invoke direct rule on Kashmir by using Articles 356 and 357 of the constitution. The decision is being seen as an essential action to ensure Kashmiri loyalty and continued integration to India. The government claims direct rule will enable the center to ensure Kashmir operates as a productive state that can bring progress and development to the people of Kashmir. Kashmiri political leaders widely condemned the action, arguing India had betrayed its promise in 1949 to preserve Kashmiri autonomy. Although there is resentment among Kashmiris, so far there are not reports of mass protests or unrest."
INDIA_KAS60s.8.d:0 "The Indian Parliament has passed a series of legislation and amendments to the Kashmiri state economy which has largely undermined the Article 370 guarantees regarding internal autonomy. The post of Prime Minister has been abolished, only to be replaced with the titles of Governor and Chief Minister to ensure Kashmir is consistent with other Indian states. The Indian government has rejected criticism from many Kashmiri political leaders and Pakistan that it is going back on its promises. Instead the Indian government claims without these reforms, Kashmiris will miss out on developmental funds and democratic reforms enjoyed by other Indian states. Some Kashmiri leaders are supporting the efforts, leading to divisions within the Jammu and Kashmir National Conference. The Indian government insists its actions are for domestic improvement and does not undermine its commitments to Kashmiris or the international community."
INDIA_KAS60s.9.d:0 "The Jammu and Kashmir National Conference, the legal political party advocating for the preservation of Kashmiri autonomy, recently voted to dissolve itself. This is the first step of a plan to merge the party as a branch of the Indian National Congress. The National Conference believes only through working with the central government and a national party can they ensure the continued preservation of Kashmiri autonomy within India. They argue the lack of such contacts led to the recent imposition of state rule. However, the action has caused a rival faction to split from the National Conference. This group, led by supporters of Sheikh Abdullah have formed a group called the Plebiscite Front. The Plebiscite Front advocates for the implementation of the UN sponsored Plebiscite to determine the future of Kashmir. The division of Kashmiri "

Sino_India_Pact.1.d:0 "India has requested we honor our defense pact and join them against China. The recent border conflict between the two has escalated into a general conflict. Considering our own dispute with India, there are some officials who believe we should offer aid only with a guarantee that the UN resolutions on Kashmir be implemented after the conflict. Other officials believe the Chinese aggression is a regional threat and we should honor the treaty. Finally, there are those in the government who believe we should simply deny we are obligated to help and let India bleed out. A decision is needed."
Sino_India_Pact.2.d:0 "According to the terms of our mutual defense treaty, we recently called on Pakistan to join us in the face of a massive Chinese invasion. The Pakistanis claim though they sympathize with our situation, the people of Pakistan remain passionate over the plight of Kashmiris. They insist we must agree to implementing the UN resolutions on Kashmir after the conflict. Doing so would resolve any animosity and enable Pakistan to completely come to our side. Considering the military situation, a number of officials are interested in accepting the terms believing it offers short term and long term benefits. However, a number of officials are opposed, seeing it as a surrender to Pakistani aggression, they believe we should go it alone."
Sino_India_Pact.3.d:0 "The Pakistan government announced it would be honoring its defence pact with India and join the fight against Chinese aggression.  Both governments also confirmed an agreement was reached with regards to Kashmir, reflecting this new spirit of unity in South Asia. Both nations will implement existing UN resolutions to resolve the status of Kashmir after the conflict with China is resolved. Pakistani troops are said to be rapidly mobilizing. The Chinese government condemned the agreement, calling it shameless jingoism."
Sino_India_Pact.4.d:0 "Pakistan and India could not agree on terms for Pakistan joining the war against China on the side of India. Neither government has revealed what went wrong, though there are rumors that continued tensions over the final status of Kashmir prevented an agreement. The Pakistan media claims the government is not obligated to intervene as it is not clear who started the Indo-Sino conflict. Indian newspapers claim Pakistan renegade the defence pact and sought to blackmail the Indian government. Regardless of the true cause, it is clear Pakistan will not intervene to support India."
Sino_India_Pact.5.d:0 "The Pakistan government, following talks with senior Indian officials, confirmed it would honor the defence pact and join the fight against China. The Pakistani leadership noted this crisis is not a time for politics or squabble, the people of the subcontinent must work together to prevent a new foreign power seeking to dominate. The Pakistan Army is said to be rapidly mobilizing. The Indian government welcomed the news. There are reports of protests from Kashmiri communities in Pakistani cities and members of religious parties condemning the decision. They believe Pakistan has betrayed the Kashmiri cause by not demanding its resolution in exchange for support."

Pak_India_War_65.1.d:0 "The Pakistan Army recently launched Operation Nusrat. Pakistani forces along the Kashmir ceasefire lines are conducting reconnaissance operations to find gaps and infiltration points along the border. Small incursions are also being launched to test response times and local civilian reaction to our movements. The knowledge we are gaining will be crucial in potential operations in Kashmir. It appears the Indians are not aware of the full extent of our operations. Our troops are highly motivated and confident, these operations are raising morale and experience."
Pak_India_War_65.2.d:0 "After a series of high-level meetings involving senior officials from the cabinet and military, it was decided to reactivate Operation Gibraltar, a plan originally conceived in the early 1950s. The plan calls for the infiltration of Pakistani troops disguised as freedom fighters. These men would then conduct sabotage operations and encourage a popular uprising to end Indian rule in Kashmir. All of the soldiers involved are to be recruited from the Azad Kashmir Regiment. The plan is to conduct a month of specialized training before sending them over the border. Nine infiltration forces have been designated, each named after a famous figure from Islamic history."
Pak_India_War_65.3.d:0 "Columns of the infiltration forces crossed the border in Kashmir. They began moving to their planned areas of operations. However, the infiltration did not go as smoothly as we hoped. Some groups were discovered by locals who informed Indian authorities. They assumed our armed men, dressed as civilians, were armed criminals and not freedom fighters. Other forces are moving far slower to their areas of operations. Despite these setbacks, we have already received reports of some sabotage operations and armed clashes with Indian forces. Intercepted communications indicate the Indian Army believes an armed uprising maybe occurring. Ideally the locals will soon come to this conclusion as well and join in an uprising. Once the uprising begins in earnest our forces will advance to complete the liberation."
Pak_India_War_65.4.d:0 "Operation Gibraltar has not advanced the way we had hoped. Many locals have either stayed away from our fighters or have led Indian forces to their camps. Most of our infiltration groups have taken heavy losses, with some even retreating to the border. At this point the Indian Army clearly realizes they are facing our troops and not insurgents. There have been heavy fire fights and some sabotage operations but not to the extent we hoped. We may need to consider escalating to phase two with a direct attack along the border by our forces to save the situation and not lose momentum."
Pak_India_War_65.5.d:0 "Our infiltration bands successfully crossed into occupied Kashmir. Since arriving, they have successfully targeted key Indian military and infrastructure sites. Our fighters are successfully sowing chaos in Kashmir, with emboldened Kashmiri activists launching protests in Srinagar. As our operations continue, the Indian government will be forced to engage with us or risk the complete isolation of the Indian Army in Kashmir. While the GHQ is celebrating the success, believing Kashmir will fall soon, there are some officials raising concerns. They argue the Indians may instead seek to escalate the situation, especially since by now they recognize just how involved the Pakistan Army is in spearheading the unrest."
Pak_India_War_65.6.d:0 "Over the past few weeks our forces in Kashmir have engaged in heavy fighting against numerous groups of armed fighters. At first our local intelligence feared this was the beginning of an armed rebellion among the Kashmiris. However, it is now clear from the reports from locals and captured fighters that these are Pakistani regulars. We have two options in front of us, we can launch border offensives to punish the Pakistanis and take the fight to them. If we break through, we could improve our position along the ceasefire line and maybe even push for a resolution in Kashmir. The other option is to simply continue our operations to root out the infiltrators and restore normalcy in Kashmir as soon as possible."
Pak_India_War_65.7.d:0 "Over the past few weeks, our forces in Kashmir have engaged in heavy fighting against numerous groups of armed fighters. At first our local intelligence feared this was the beginning of an armed rebellion among the Kashmiris. However, it is now clear from the reports from locals and captured fighters that these are Pakistani regulars. These infiltrators have caused extensive damage to the local infrastructure and we have troubling reports of some local Kashmiris joining the fighters. With the situation deteriorating we are left with two options. We can launch offensives along the ceasefire line to punish the Pakistanis and relieve pressure. The other option is to announce our support for implementing UN resolution 47 and hold a plebiscite."
Pak_India_War_65.8.d:0 "In response to Operation Grand Slam the Indian Army has launched offensives along the Kashmir ceasefire line. Our forces were caught off guard in certain sectors but are tenaciously resisting. With the grace of Allah, we will soon repulse this attack. Our commanders on the ground are confident that in time we will soon take the fight to the Indians and complete our mission to finally liberate Kashmir from its occupation."
Pak_India_War_65.9.d:0 "The Indian offensive along the ceasefire line has largely been repulsed by the Pakistan Army. Although the Indian forces appeared to make some initial gains, localized Pakistani counterattacks held firm. In particular, Indian forces appeared close to capturing the Haji Pir pass but were halted. Observers are watching the situation closely to see if Pakistan will launch its own offensive in response or work to cool down the escalating situation. This recent round of fighting was brought about after India discovered Pakistani troops were infiltrating into their controlled part of Kashmir to launch attacks. Both the United States and Soviet Union released statements calling for calm in the region."
Pak_India_War_65.10.d:0 "The Indian offensive along the ceasefire line in Kashmir is making dangerous gains against Pakistani forces. The Indian Army recently announced its forces were now firmly in control of the Haji Pir pass. This revelation marks a major setback for Pakistani forces and threatens Muzaffarabad. It appears these offensives are limited in nature and not an all-out assault on Pakistani controlled Kashmir. The Indian government reiterated that Pakistan must withdraw all its infiltration forces from Indian Kashmir and that the recent military action was a direct response to Pakistani aggression. The Pakistan government has remained largely quiet. There are fears of further escalation in Kashmir despite calls from the United States and Soviet Union for a restoration of peace."
Pak_India_War_65.11.d:0 "With Indian pressure mounting on the ceasefire line and in occupied Kashmir, the senior Pakistan Army commanders have planned Operation Grand Slam. This offensive will relieve pressure on our troops already committed to action and if it succeeds, we could potentially cut off India from occupied Kashmir. The thrust of the offensive will be directed to Akhnoor. If we seize the city, Kashmir will be cut off and our we can finally complete the liberation of Kashmir. The troops are positioned, and we just need to approve the operation to get it underway."
Pak_India_War_65.12.d:0 "Operation Grand Slam is making tremendous gains. Our forces are rapidly moving towards Akhnoor and once it is secured, we will be able to cutoff the Indian Army and even take Jammu. Reports from our officers on the front praise the effectiveness and morale of our soldiers. They believe once India is cut off, they will have to evacuate the Kashmir Valley or risk losing all its forces in Kashmir. The Air Force and Navy have gone on high alert, especially along the international border. However, latest intelligence reports indicate India will not likely escalate the conflict beyond Kashmir."
Pak_India_War_65.13.d:0 "Operation Grand Slam has largely stalled. Our initial attack, especially the artillery, performed magnificently. However, our forces encountered difficult terrain and a much more tenacious defensive force than was expected. Although it is clear we are not threatening to cut India off from Kashmir, the offensive has succeeded in relieving pressure on our other forces and stabilizing the ceasefire line. Our men will fight on and hopefully a new opportunity will emerge. However, what is clear is that the situation in Kashmir is spiraling out of our hands rapidly."
Pak_India_War_65.14.d:0 "The massive Pakistani offensive towards Akhnoor caught our forces completely off guard. However, despite their superiority in numbers and equipment, our men are fighting bravely. The local commander says his forces can certainly hold the Pakistanis for several more days, however, he fears the size of the attacking force and does not feel he has enough reserves. The situation has left us with two options. One is to declare our intention to implement UN resolution 47 on Kashmir and commit to the process. Although difficult, we may end up losing Kashmir but not on the battlefield. We can certainly find a moment to punish the Pakistanis later.

They insisted Pakistan was the victim of unlawful aggression and stated they were monitoring the situation closely. We have received reports of Chinese troop movements along the border. The implication appears to be that if we continue the conflict, China may choose to intervene against us. This is important to consider. However, several advisors dismissed the statement as bravado and insist China would not actually intervene. They argue China is just trying to show Pakistan its support without actually committing forces."

The United Nations added in their communication that a ceasefire is the desire of the global community. We are meeting with our top military and government officials to assess the situation on the ground. Clearly the Pakistanis want an end to the fighting and we can agree to that. However, our diplomats said they could delay the ceasefire for a maximum of ten days before international pressure becomes too much. If we feel another ten days of fighting could benefit our final position, we can also do that."

The United Nations added in their communication that a ceasefire is the desire of the global community. We are meeting with our top brass and officials to assess the situation. We can certainly agree to the ceasefire now, which India is advocating at this stage. However, the Foreign Ministry believes we can use delaying tactics and delay a ceasefire for up to ten days before international pressure becomes too much. If we feel another ten days of fighting could improve our final position, we can also do that."
Pak_India_War_65.33.d:0 "A United Nations sponsored ceasefire has finally come into effect, at least temporarily halting the current Indo-Pakistan conflict. Both sides appear to be adhering to the ceasefire. The United Nations released a statement claiming with the fighting stopped, observers will soon arrive to help ensure there are no major ceasefire violations or territorial grabs by the two sides. The leaders of India and Pakistan are also expected to meet soon and seek to formally end the conflict.

#Operation Nusrat (fires after PAK_Operation_Nusrat focus is completed)
#"The Pakistan Army recently launched Operation Nusrat. Pakistani forces along the Kashmir ceasefire lines are conducting reconnaissance operations to find gaps and infiltration points along the border. Small incursions are also being launched to test response times and local civilian reaction to our movements. The knowledge we are gaining will be crucial in potential operations in Kashmir. It appears the Indians are not aware of the full extent of our operations. Our troops are highly motivated and confident, these operations are raising morale and experience."
#-Good (national spirit, Operation Nusrat, increase in army intelligence, boost in attack, defense, morale, and organization)
#Selecting Men for Operation Gibraltar (fires from PAK_Prepare_For_Operation_Gibraltar)
#"After a series of high-level meetings involving senior officials from the cabinet and military, it was decided to reactivate Operation Gibraltar, a plan originally conceived in the early 1950s. The plan calls for the infiltration of Pakistani troops disguised as freedom fighters. These men would then conduct sabotage operations and encourage a popular uprising to end Indian rule in Kashmir. All of the soldiers involved are to be recruited from the Azad Kashmir Regiment. The plan is to conduct a month of specialized training before sending them over the border. Nine infiltration forces have been designated, each named after a famous figure from Islamic history."
#-Operation Gibraltar will soon be ready (Launch Operation Gibraltar in 30 Days)
#Launch Operation Gibraltar
#"Columns of the infiltration forces crossed the border in Kashmir. They began moving to their planned areas of operations. However, the infiltration did not go as smoothly as we hoped. Some groups were discovered by locals who informed Indian authorities. They assumed our armed men, dressed as civilians, were armed criminals and not freedom fighters. Other forces are moving far slower to their areas of operations. Despite these setbacks, we have already received reports of some sabotage operations and armed clashes with Indian forces. Intercepted communications indicate the Indian Army believes an armed uprising maybe occurring. Ideally the locals will soon come to this conclusion as well and join in an uprising. Once the uprising begins in earnest our forces will advance to complete the liberation."
#-It Commences [in thirty days the next event comes its either Operation Gibraltar Not Effective (75 percent chance) or Operation Gibraltar Very Effective (25 percent chance)]
#Operation Gibraltar Not Effective
#"Operation Gibraltar has not advanced the way we had hoped. Many locals have either stayed away from our fighters or have led Indian forces to their camps. Most of our infiltration groups have taken heavy losses, with some even retreating to the border. At this point the Indian Army clearly realizes they are facing our troops and not insurgents. There have been heavy fire fights and some sabotage operations but not to the extent we hoped. We may need to consider escalating to phase two with a direct attack along the border by our forces to save the situation and not lose momentum."
#-Troubling News (in three days India gets Problems in Kashmir event)
#Operation Gibraltar Very Effective
#Problems in Kashmir (Indian Event)
#"Over the past few weeks our forces in Kashmir have engaged in heavy fighting against numerous groups of armed fighters. At first our local intelligence feared this was the beginning of an armed rebellion among the Kashmiris. However, it is now clear from the reports from locals and captured fighters that these are Pakistani regulars. We have two options in front of us, we can launch border offensives to punish the Pakistanis and take the fight to them. If we break through, we could improve our position along the ceasefire line and maybe even push for a resolution in Kashmir. The other option is to simply continue our operations to root out the infiltrators and restore normalcy in Kashmir as soon as possible."

At first our local intelligence feared this was the beginning of an armed rebellion among the Kashmiris. However, it is now clear from the reports from locals and captured fighters that these are Pakistani regulars. These infiltrators have caused extensive damage to the local infrastructure and we have troubling reports of some local Kashmiris joining the fighters. With the situation deteriorating we are left with two options. We can launch offensives along the ceasefire line to punish the Pakistanis and relieve pressure. The other option is to announce our support for implementing UN resolution 47 and hold a plebiscite."

#"In response to Operation Grand Slam the Indian Army has launched offensives along the Kashmir ceasefire line. Our forces were caught off guard in certain sectors but are tenaciously resisting. With the grace of Allah, we will soon repulse this attack. Our commanders on the ground are confident that in time we will soon take the fight to the Indians and complete our mission to finally liberate Kashmir from its occupation."
#-All will be well (India starts border war in Kashmir, if they win, Indian Forces Make Gains is fired, if not, Indian Forces Repulsed is fired)
#Indian Forces Repulsed (Pakistan/India event)
#"The Indian offensive along the ceasefire line has largely been repulsed by the Pakistan Army. Although the Indian forces appeared to make some initial gains, localized Pakistani counterattacks held firm. In particular, Indian forces appeared close to capturing the Haji Pir pass but were halted. Observers are watching the situation closely to see if Pakistan will launch its own offensive in response or work to cool down the escalating situation. This recent round of fighting was brought about after India discovered Pakistani troops were infiltrating into their controlled part of Kashmir to launch attacks. Both the United States and Soviet Union released statements calling for calm in the region."
#-Keep the pressure on? (if focus Operation Gibraltar completed, event Operation Gibraltar fires, India gains national spirit "Kashmir setback" small drop in organization, morale, attack, and defense)
#Indian Forces Make Gains (Pakistan Event)
#"The Indian offensive along the ceasefire line in Kashmir is making dangerous gains against Pakistani forces. The Indian Army recently announced its forces were now firmly in control of the Haji Pir pass. This revelation marks a major setback for Pakistani forces and threatens Muzaffarabad. It appears these offensives are limited in nature and not an all-out assault on Pakistani controlled Kashmir. The Indian government reiterated that Pakistan must withdraw all its infiltration forces from Indian Kashmir and that the recent military action was a direct response to Pakistani aggression. The Pakistan government has remained largely quiet. There are fears of further escalation in Kashmir despite calls from the United States and Soviet Union for a restoration of peace."
#-A befitting reply (Haji Pir Pass ceded to India, if focus Operation Gibraltar completed, event Operation Gibraltar fires, India gains spirit "Kashmir advantage" small increase in organization, morale, attack and defense, Pakistan loses spirit "Operation Nusrat"
#Operation Grand Slam (if focus completed and one of the pre-request events has fired, Pakistan event)
#"With Indian pressure mounting on the ceasefire line and in occupied Kashmir, the senior Pakistan Army commanders have planned Operation Grand Slam. This offensive will relieve pressure on our troops already committed to action and if it succeeds, we could potentially cut off India from occupied Kashmir. The thrust of the offensive will be directed to Akhnoor. If we seize the city, Kashmir will be cut off and our we can finally complete the liberation of Kashmir. The troops are positioned, and we just need to approve the operation to get it underway."
#-Launch the operation (new border war launched by Pakistan, if it wins, Operation Grand Slam Makes Gains launches, if not, Operation Grand Slam Stalls follows
#Operation Grand Slam Makes Gains (Pakistan event)
#"Operation Grand Slam is making tremendous gains. Our forces are rapidly moving towards Akhnoor and once it is secured, we will be able to cutoff the Indian Army and even take Jammu. Reports from our officers on the front praise the effectiveness and morale of our soldiers. They believe once India is cut off, they will have to evacuate the Kashmir Valley or risk losing all its forces in Kashmir. The Air Force and Navy have gone on high alert, especially along the international border. However, latest intelligence reports indicate India will not likely escalate the conflict beyond Kashmir."
#-On to Srinagar! (India gets Akhnoor Threatened, Pakistan should gain the territory west of Jammu in the map, threatening Jammu and cutting off easy access for Indian troops into Kashmir. Pakistan also should lose focus "Operation Nusrat". So maybe the map should be adjusted with an opening into Kashmir from the Pakistan bank of the Chenab River. Essentially, in the new map, I would like to see the region south of Poonch and west of Jammu, that is along the Pakistan border ceded to Pakistan, and their should be an opening from the Pakistan province bordering it that has a river bank with the Chenab river)
#Operation Grand Slam Stalls 
#"Operation Grand Slam has largely stalled. Our initial attack, especially the artillery, performed magnificently. However, our forces encountered difficult terrain and a much more tenacious defensive force than was expected. Although it is clear we are not threatening to cut India off from Kashmir, the offensive has succeeded in relieving pressure on our other forces and stabilizing the ceasefire line. Our men will fight on and hopefully a new opportunity will emerge. However, what is clear is that the situation in Kashmir is spiraling out of our hands rapidly."
#-Hold firm! (Pakistan loses spirit Operation Nusrat, India gets event "Expand the Conflict Zone?")
#Akhnoor Threatened: Expanding the Conflict Zone? (Indian Player)
#"The massive Pakistani offensive towards Akhnoor caught our forces completely off guard. However, despite their superiority in numbers and equipment, our men are fighting bravely. The local commander says his forces can certainly hold the Pakistanis for several more days, however, he fears the size of the attacking force and does not feel he has enough reserves. The situation has left us with two options. One is to declare our intention to implement UN resolution 47 on Kashmir and commit to the process. Although difficult, we may end up losing Kashmir but not on the battlefield. We can certainly find a moment to punish the Pakistanis later. The other option, by far the most popular one, is to expand the conflict and attack West Pakistan from the international border. This will relieve pressure and we can quickly seize the city of Lahore to use as a bargaining chip. The only other alternative is a military disaster in Kashmir."

Instead we can offer either arms or vehemently condemn Indian aggression during this conflict."

The implication appears to be that if we continue the conflict, China may choose to intervene against us. This is important to consider. However, several advisors dismissed the statement as bravado and insist China would not actually intervene. They argue China is just trying to show Pakistan its support without actually committing forces."

The purpose of these talks is to reach a final agreement to end the recent war fought between the two South Asian powers. The war began when Pakistan attempted to de-freeze the current situation in Kashmir, this led to a military escalation that culminated into open war. The Pakistani leadership will be pushing for a settlement on Kashmir, preferably the implementation of previous UN resolutions on the issue. However, experts believe the Indian government will likely reject such pressures and instead press to make the pre-war ceasefire line the permanent border. Many analysts believe the conflict on the ground was largely inconclusive and it would be surprising if either party could convince the other. For the Soviets, the meeting gives them a chance to demonstrate their claim of being a neutral or friendly world power to the newly emerging post-colonial states."

He stated that a failure to do so would only allow the conflict to fester and alienate the Kashmiris. After these talks, the Prime Minister discussed with his advisors. The consensus was that we remain firmly in control of our portion of Kashmir and should not legitimize Pakistani aggression by agreeing. Instead they stated we can offer to make the pre-war Kashmir cease fire line the permanent border. The Prime Minister heard these comments and must now decide whether he will go out on a limb and accept the Pakistani position or counter the offer."

Pakistan has long pushed for India to take this action and the recent war was largely fought to force a resolution on Kashmir. Although the military conflict ended inconclusively for Pakistan and many analysts predicted India would seek to restore the pre-war status quo. The United Nations have welcomed the decision, while nations across the globe are praising India for its statesmanship and desire for lasting peace in South Asia.

However, as the Pakistan military began achieving military victories, those apprehensions soon dissolved. The Bengali press praised the military successes, while the military and federal government offered their admiration to the support and sacrifices made by the people of East Pakistan. With the war over and peace talks about to commence, Bengali patriotism towards Pakistan appears renewed. To reciprocate this new feeling of unity, the Pakistan government announced the inclusion of a prominent Bengali provincial leader as part of the Pakistani negotiating team for the Lahore talks."

They say now is the moment for both of our nations to step back and let the Kashmiri people choose their destiny. Certainly, this is what we have always wanted, but our position is such that we can simply demand India vacate Kashmir and not risk an international vote, which could potentially be interfered with by the Indians. We may never have such a strong negotiating position ever again and leaving it to the UN may backfire. However, accepting the Indian offer and then gaining Kashmir through a UN vote would make our success more legitimate internationally."

Regardless, this is a far more favorable result than being asked to completely vacate Kashmir. With this agreement, we can expect a return to pre-war borders on the international border along with a prisoner exchange, once we commit to the United Nations route.

The English press in Pakistan is praising the President for achieving Pakistani objectives in a way that does not humiliate India and preserve the international standing of the nation. The Urdu press, however, is much more scathing, accusing the government of picking international image over using their position of strength to force India out.

Indeed, the recent war fought between the two sides was over who controlled Kashmir. India was forced to offer the implementation of the resolutions as the military conflict left them in a very weak position. Because of this, the agreement surprised some observers who thought Pakistan would simply use its position to force India out of Kashmir and take it for itself. It appears the Pakistanis are working to not force a peace that would provoke further animosity from India or give an international image of Pakistan as a militarily aggressive power. It is also clear the Pakistanis were confident the vote will give Kashmir to them."

The Pakistanis instead stated that the Indian situation in Kashmir was clearly untenable and India should vacate the former Princely State. The Pakistanis softened this hardline stance by adding that if we comply, they will immediately restore the international border to the pre-war borders and exchange POWs. Certainly we cannot permanently accept the occupation of major Indian cities. However, some advisors suggest we offer the Pakistanis a partition plan for Kashmir in which we retain Jammu and Ladakh, this would allow each part of Kashmir to be with their co-religionists."

The Indians noted that historically Jammu was non-Muslim and the First Kashmir War drove many non-Muslims from the Valley to Jammu. That population would be apprehensive to a Pakistani government and to prevent animosity or a new cycle of communal unrest, perhaps we should partition Kashmir. They would give us all of Kashmir except for Jammu and Ladakh. Accepting this Partition Plan would achieve our goal of controlling the Valley and remove the potential headache of integrating Kashmiri non-Muslims. It would also avoid us inheriting the Indian border dispute with China.

Obviously, this is a desperate ploy by the Pakistanis, we will soon inform the Pakistanis that it was they who upset the status quo. Because of this they must recognize the new reality on the ground, as such we will state that Pakistan must cede all of its occupied Kashmir to us. The Kashmir Princely State acceded to India and Pakistan must recognize this reality."

#India Insists on all of Kashmir (Pakistan event)
#"Our efforts at trying to restore the pre-war borders was soundly rejected. The Indians are in no mood to consider this. They feel like we caused the unrest and they cannot stop until they get something from us. Our next option is to trade our claim to the Kashmir Valley for a restoration of peace. We will propose a partition for Kashmir where we retain Gilgit and Baltistan but cede the rest to India. We have been defeated this time, but we will recover and never abandon Kashmir."
#-Hopefully they accept this (India gets "Pakistan Asks for Partition")
#Pakistan Asks for Partition
#"The Pakistani delegation has realized we are not in a mood to let them off the hook. In the latest rounds of talk they have offered to cede their so-called Azad Kashmir to us but asked to retain Gilgit-Baltistan. During the First Kashmir War, Gilgit-Baltistan quickly fell to the Pakistanis as they had the support of local militia forces there. Their proposal may make a great deal of sense for us. We would avoid inheriting a hostile population and succeed in uniting the Kashmir Valley. Internationally it would also be a welcomed outcome. However, many of our hawks are saying we cannot lose this advantage and we should press the Pakistanis to leave Kashmir."
#-We can accept this partition (Pakistan gets "India Accepts the Partition Plan")
#-Pakistan must leave Kashmir (Pakistan gets "India Will not Budge")
#India Accepts the Partition Plan (Pakistan event)
#"The Indian government has accepted our proposal on partitioning Kashmir. With a heavy heart, we have already given orders for our officials and remaining troops to leave Azad Kashmir. Already there are reports of Kashmiri families fleeing to safety in Pakistan. However, considering the alternative, this was the best result. We will never abandon Kashmir however, our hands are tied. The Indian government has agreed to withdraw their own forces from our territory and exchange POWs and restore diplomatic ties. We can only pray the future will give us an opportunity to right this historical injustice."

#"News of our agreement in Delhi have led to mass agitation across our cities. There is genuine shock as many Pakistanis were under the impression our forces were doing well in the war. The early arrival of refugees from Azad Kashmir is fueling the anger. Within the military, there is rumors of tension between senior officers and their subordinates. Many young officers felt the military setbacks were due not to Indian superiority but a failure of leadership. We must work to reunite our people in this moment of crisis."

#India Will Not Budge (Pakistan event)
#"The Indian delegation revealed their greediness and ambition by rejecting our just offer for a partition in Kashmir. The Indians stated the only scenario they will accept for a restoration of the international border and peace is our complete withdrawal from Kashmir. Due to the military balance, we are left with no choice but to comply. With a heavy heart, we must order our forces out of Kashmir. The consequences and backlash will be immense from the people. However, we have no choice, but considering the injustice of the situation, in time, we will be redeemed. Our delegates will soon sign the final treaty."
