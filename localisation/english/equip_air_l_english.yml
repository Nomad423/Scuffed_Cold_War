 aerosub_0_desc:0 "The flying submarine is an amphibious naval bomber plane capable of submerging itself to evade enemy anti-air fire and improve stealth. Using either air or sea cover, the flying submarine is more defensible at a substantial cost and tradeoff to performance.\nOriginally thought of by unnamed British high command officers and reported in the British trade journal 'flying', the flying submarine, or 'aerosub' was rarely ever taken seriously. In the late 30s to mid 50s, the Soviet Union took serious steps to try and create an aerosub but the project failed miserably. It would not be explored again until the early 60s where Donald Reid would design an amphibious submersible single seat aircraft that was far simpler in concept to the aerosub pursued by the Soviet Union. However, in 2008, the US DARPA agency announced it would begin to reexplore the aerosub concept."

Consequently, the Rafale M weighs about 500 kg (1,100 lb) more than the Rafale C. It is the only non-US fighter type cleared to operate from the decks of US carriers, using catapults and their arresting gear, as demonstrated in 2008 when six Rafales from Flottille 12F integrated into the USS Theodore Roosevelt Carrier Air Wing interoperability exercise."

The upgrade also included but was not limited to new avionics, such as a modern cockpit display, new IFF, and later on, an upgraded AN/ALR-68 RWR."

The type served as the primary strike aircraft for the U.S. Air Force during the Korean War, and was the first fighter aircraft used by the USAF's demonstration team, the 'Thunderbirds.'

As the design is focused entirely on stealth capabilities the aircraft is lacking in speed and maneuverability. On the flipside, however, remaining off enemy radar allows it to use guided bombs to perform pinpoint strikes. It has a unique shape comprised of plane surfaces and a special paint job in order to reflect and absorb radar waves. Known as the 'Nighthawk', it gained recognition during the 1991 Gulf War for flying more than 1200 sorties without a single one of the aircraft being shot down."

Weight savings due to elimination of wood from the airframe allowed for greatly improved fuel capacity and four-cannon armament. Mock combat demonstrated that the La-130 was evenly matched with the La-7 but was inferior to the Yakovlev Yak-3 in horizontal planes. The new fighter, officially designated La-9, entered production in August 1946. A total of 1,559 aircraft were built by the end of production in 1948."

Despite many difficulties (procuring parts that were equivalent or superior to American-developed parts, conversion from imperial to metric system, etc.) the Tu-4's first flight and entry into service was enough to panic the U.S. and Great Britain, the first of many during the Cold War.

 VIE_scout_helicopter_equipment_3_desc:0 "The upgraded 'D' variant of the Kiowa was the result of the Army Helicopter Improvement Program (AHIP). It came with features such as an upgraded transmission and engine for the chopper's nap-of-the-earth (extreme low level) flights, as well as a unique four-bladed main rotor configuration which allowed it to be much quieter than other helicopters, more so its predecessors. The OH-58D introduced the distinctive Mast-Mounted Sight (MMS) above the rotor system, and a mixed glass cockpit, with traditional instruments identified as "standby" for emergency use."

 VIE_cargo_helicopter_equipment_4_desc:0 "In October 1967, the US Marine Corps issued a requirement for a helicopter with a lifting capacity 1.8 times that of the CH-53D that would fit on amphibious warfare ships. The US Navy and US Army were also seeking similar helicopters at the time. Before issue of the requirement, Sikorsky had been working on an enhancement to the CH-53D, under the company designation "S-80", featuring a third turboshaft engine and a more powerful rotor system. Sikorsky proposed the S-80 design to the Marines in 1968. The Marines liked the idea, since it promised to deliver a good solution quickly, and funded development of a testbed helicopter for evaluation. The initial production contract was awarded in 1978, and service introduction followed in February 1981."
