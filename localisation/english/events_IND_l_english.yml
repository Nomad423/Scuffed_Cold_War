 india.1.d:0 "After more than four years of deliberations, the Constituent Assembly of India recently finalized a constitution for India. Originally, the assembly consisted of 389 members, though it reduced to 299 after partition. Many achievements were made during its sessions. The preamble is the famous Objective Resolution, originally presented by Jawaharlal Nehru in 1946. Along with major discussions in regard to castes and provincial rights, the assembly also approved the national flag. With the constitution made into the official law of India, the nation shall no longer be a Dominion but a Republic within the Commonwealth. This will allow India to be a republic but not completely cut ties with the British. Many Indians feel ending the Dominion relationship with Britain will finally break the last vestiges of colonial rule."
 Green_Revolution.1.d:0 "For decades, the Indian people were victims of famine and food insecurity. Even during the last war the colonial regime took food from the people to feed its war machine, continuing the erosion of agriculture. However, with new advances in technology and a government for the people, India will embark on a campaign to end dependence on foreign food aid and transform India into a breadbasket for Asia. Government programs combined with new research are to guide this historic program. A senior government official noted the colonial regime brought India frequent famines and failed to increase productivity as the population grew. India plans to address these issues and provide farmers the finance support they need to grow."
 Green_Revolution.2.d:0 "Parliament passed legislation guaranteeing national funding for the development of agriculture. Some of the funds will go to universities to investigate the causes of food insecurity and develop new techniques and technologies for expanding production. Other funding will secure the import and domestic development of higher yield and more disease resistant wheat and modern fertilizers. Campaigns are to be launched across the country to encourage farmers to adopt more effective irrigation techniques and to use the new technologies."
 Vietnam_IND.2.d:0 "The United States requests our support for their effort in Vietnam. They are not asking for combat troops but are saying we should at least provide a military field hospital to support the South Vietnamese people. It is clear our refusal to do so may result in an end to the current wheat aid they provide us. Some in the government believe we should offer public support for the American position. They argue the aid we get is not relevant, but accepting the American request could counter-balance the rise of global communist activists in the country. We could also expect greater American support and investments. Other officials believe we should remain firm and maintain our integrity as an international state. Supporting the neo-colonial war will only divide the republic and betray the values on which it was founded."
 Vietnam_IND.3.d:0 "The Indian government agreed to dispatch a field hospital to South Vietnam and publicly support our position in Vietnam. This will greatly hinder the communist propaganda in Asia and legitimize our cause. More importantly, senior Indian officials will now work to combat this propaganda and defend us in order to justify their actions. This is a major coup for our government. Greater effort will be made to convince American corporations and investors to focus on India, given their sensible foreign policy."
 CPI_FP.1.d:0 "In a stirring address to the nation, the Indian Prime Minister announced the withdrawal of India from the Commonwealth. The Prime Minister noted the organization served simply to continue colonial influence across former colonies and India had to leave for its true independence. After the speech, the Indian government released its own statement condemning the organization for refusing to support anti-colonial movements and legitimizing Western aggression against peaceful states. The British government expressed its disappointment and rejected the Indian accusations. The Commonwealth organization released its own statement claiming the organization simply promoted stronger ties among its members who have a shared history."
 CPI_FP.2.d:0 "The Indian government expressed its support for the Soviet Union and called on China to halt its hostile propaganda and actions. The Indian government noted the Soviet Union had a long history of supporting freedom movements and offering support to developing states. The move will likely anger the Chinese government, which has long viewed the increasingly close ties between the Soviets and Indians with concern. A leading Chinese newspaper claimed the Soviets planned on using ties with India to strategically surround China. It added that India remained a colonial client, willing to sell itself to the highest bidder. Indian newspapers were quick to support the government and condemn the Chinese for its policy of antagonism and internal repression. The Soviet Union welcomed the announcement and invited the Indian Prime Minister to visit."
 India_Reconciliation.1.d:0 "The Indian government formally requested talks with our government. The Indians claim they wish to reset relations and end the years of animosity since Partition. It is likely the Indians want to normalize relations and establish stronger trade ties. Some of our advisors feel this may help out our economy which is reeling from the recent war and losses. In addition, this could build support among the liberal elements of society. However, India is likely capitalizing on their recent military success and to engage them may be seen as acknowledging our weak position. It may be better for the morale of our people to reject this initiative and focus on our efforts to rebuild. We must decide how to respond."
 India_Reconciliation.2.d:0 "During our talks with India, they have proposed a complete normalization of relations along with an agreement to ease immigration restrictions. The agreement would improve relations, especially trade ties. Our own population would likely support the easing of immigration, this would allow the reunion of families and friends long separated by Partition and offer opportunity for some citizens to reclaim lost properties. However, there is some resistance, especially among senior military officers who believe the best approach would be to walk away from the talks and end the talks. This would assert Pakistani defiance. We must decide how to respond."
 India_Reconciliation.3.d:0 "Our recent effort to normalize relations with Pakistan has ended in success. The Pakistanis agreed to sign a range of agreements which will improve trade, normalize relations, and ease immigration restrictions. News of the agreement is already being positively received domestically and internationally. The world now sees India is a new type of power. Indians and Pakistanis can now become like the brothers and sisters they were meant to be. We are not a militarist power or imperialistic, instead we are a peace-loving nation devoted to continuous peace."
 India_Reconciliation.4.d:0 "The Indian effort at normalizing ties with Pakistan ended in embarrassing failure. The Pakistanis condemned the Indians for seeking to cement their recent successes and turn Pakistan into an Indian puppet. The Pakistan government released a further statement claiming they will never give up on their desire to liberate the people of Kashmir and prevent India from becoming a hegemonic power in South Asia. The Indian government responded by saying Pakistan was politicizing a genuine effort at peace and they had only revealed their desire for war."

 india.7.t:0 "People's Republic of India Established!"
 india.7.d:0 "Today in Delhi, the flag of the People's Republic of India was raised and the Republic of India flag lowered. The People's Republic of India has claimed victory in their revolutionary war against the Republic of India. The PRI leadership has said they have liberated the country from the princes and corrupt Republican Indian leaders that took from rightful commoners. The last of Republic of India forces and people have crossed into neighboring Pakistan or Burma and also left to Ceylon. NATO has called this a failure and a setback in the South Asia region. Cominform is calling this a success for opening up the doors to South Asia and the Middle East for liberation and revolution. The fighting has ended in India, but the exiled Indians have claimed that the fight is not over."

 india.8.d:0 "The last rebel forces in the state of Hyderabad have been found in the mountains and surrendered. The People's Republic of India has surrendered in Hyderabad after the last of their forces were hunted down by the Indian Army. India has instituted a occupation force to make sure any last forces are wiped out. The Republic of India has called this a great victory in their country."

 Vietnam_IND.1.d:0 "The situation in Vietnam continues to escalate. Internationally, the North Vietnamese propaganda has resonated across the post-colonial states, including India. The Indian government does not do much to  curb such blatant support for the communist rebels. Our diplomatic missions report a rise in anti-Americanism and an increasing view that the war we are fighting is a war of colonialism, not one to protect the Vietnamese people from communist tyranny. The State Department recommends we call for the Indian government to openly back our position, educate the population, and dispatch a military field hospital to South Vietnam. Asking for combat troops would not be realistic, but such a support would strengthen our position and legitimacy in Asia. If India resists, we can threaten to cut our wheat aid. Some in the cabinet oppose this plan, claiming we will simply drive the Indians out of our camp and lose what leverage we have."

 India_Emergency.21.d:0 "The Indian Parliament passed the thirty ninth amendment, making it the second amendment passed since the Emergency was declared. The new law places judicial restrictions on its ability to investigate the position of Prime Minister. It essentially makes the electoral fraud case being brought against Prime Minister Indira Gandhi invalid. The government argues the new law will ensure the judiciary cannot interfere in the governance of the nation by invalidating politicians on superficial charges. The opposition decried the decision, noting this is just the latest in a series of amendments passed since 1970 that have dramatically weakened the power of the judiciary."

 Srikakulum.1.d:0 "In recent weeks, tensions in Srikakulam escalated after two pro-peasant communist members were murdered, allegedly by a group of landlords. In response, communist activists rallied peasant tribal people to join them in seizing land and food from the landlords. The bands of peasants are cultivating lands held for decades by local elites but unused. So far efforts by local authorities to negotiate a resolution and reduce the tensions has failed. The local authorities told the media they may soon deploy the police and stop criminal acts from spreading across the region and condemned activists for misleading peasants for their own nefarious agendas."
 Srikakulum.2.d:0 "The peasant unrest in Srikakulum recently escalated to peasant raids targeting landlords. The raids occurred following the alleged murder of communist activists by the landlords. Regardless, the law and order situation rapidly declined, forcing the local police to be deployed. The police operations have largely failed, their raids are ineffective and rebel peasants successfully stormed several police posts, causing officers to flee. Of a larger concern are recent massive raids by the peasant fighters. In one instance, several hundred peasants stormed the property of one landlord, stealing food and tens of thousands of rupees worth of goods. Only weeks later, another mass of rebel peasants assaulted a village and its local police, numbering several hundred, the officers were forced to flee after taking heavy losses. With the situation escalating, the Indian government announced it would deploy paramilitary forces to the region."
 Srikakulum.3.d:0 "The situation in Srikakulum has largely been restored following the deployment of paramilitary forces. These troops led by competent officers and far better equipped than the peasant forcers were able to disperse rebel bands and force many of the peasants to abandon their armed resistance. Several communist leaders were also killed in raids by the security forces, greatly weakening the organization of the peasants. The military has drastically reduced operations and lifted emergency restrictions as it appears most peasants have abandoned the armed resistance and surviving communist leaders are underground. The writ of law and order appears to be returning to India, but these agitators of rural peasants are still hiding amongst the people."

 INC_60s.1.d:0 "The Indian National Congress Party has been on the forefront of freedom and progress since its foundation in 1885. It was Congress who led the freedom struggle and helped forge a united India built on ideas of secularism, equality, and democracy. However, the party has a wide variety of perspectives and views within it. The Prime Minister in recent months has noticed a schism beginning to form with the more leftist wing of the party and the more right-wing faction. The leftists continue to advocate for socialist policies and the promotion of wealth equality. However, the right, led by Moraji Desai bemoans the shift towards what they see is a foreign socialist ideology and an inability to promote traditional Gandhian values. They also believe the government should support responsible business communities to promote the Indian economy."
 INC_60s.2.d:0 "Efforts by the Prime Minister to negotiate support with the two wings of the Congress Party ended in disaster following a ruling made by the party leadership to expel Prime Minister Indira Gandhi from the party. The Prime Minister is accused of violating party discipline and many believe this is a result of her active support of more leftist policies. In response, Indira Gandhi announced she would form her own faction of the India National Congress made of her supporters and maintain her government through a coalition. The remaining India National Congress members have organized under the leadership of Moraji Desai, a famed freedom fighter and champion of the values espoused by Mahatma Gandhi. He pledged his party would not follow foreign ideologies but instead strengthen the economy and champion the society envisioned by the Mahatma."

 Smiling_Buddha.1.d:0 "The Indian Prime Minister secretly directed the Bhabha Atomic Research Center to begin preparations for assembling and producing a nuclear device for a test. The preparations were completed, and last night India detonated a nuclear device. The Indian government confirmed the detonation, code-named Smiling Buddha, and called it a peaceful nuclear test. The current international and regional climate necessitates India assert its position. The nuclear bomb is the most powerful weapon on the planet and demonstrating our possession of it will put India in elite company. The Prime Minister kept strict control over information related to the test and its preparations, which is why much of the Indian government, people, and even military were caught off-guard by the news. The public reaction has largely been positive as Indians now see themselves as among the global elite and the premier power of the region."
 Smiling_Buddha.2.d:0 "The Indian government confirmed it had detonated a nuclear device recently in an operation it called ‘Smiling Buddha’. The explosion, conducted underground caught the world by surprise and its detonation was felt as far as Islamabad. The Indian media and much of its government expressed its surprise but joy at the news of India joining the elite Nuclear Club. Pakistan was quick to condemn the Indian test as a provocation and escalation, while vowing to not be cowed into silence. Despite these defiant words, the Indian government appears unfazed and insisted the test was not military in nature and purely represented a major scientific achievement for India. The other major powers have remained largely quiet, but the United States is expected to make a statement soon."
 Smiling_Buddha.3.d:0 "India recently detonated a nuclear device, making it a new nuclear power. The Indian government insists the test was purely scientific and not military. Our own intelligence sources conclude that the Indian military was largely excluded from the planning of the test, though its senior officers were updated on the preparation and progress of the test. India will certainly build a nuclear arsenal, at the very least to act as a deterrence. The test upsets any balance of power in South Asia and we fear other states, especially Pakistan, may also seek to advance their nuclear capabilities. We have two ways to respond, we can sanction India for bringing nuclear weapons into the region without any warning, or we could simply express concerns to the Indians. Our own domestic population does not seem too bothered by the test, but providing sanctions would boost ties with Pakistan."

 IND_BENGAL.1.d:0 "The Pakistan Army recently launched a crackdown in East Pakistan. Their brutal violence has escalated the situation and resulted in a growing refugee crisis. Pakistanis, especially Hindus, are fleeing to Calcutta from East Pakistan. They are bringing stories of atrocities and brutal repression. The international media is covering the situation while local authorities are setting up emergency refugee camps. Reports from the border suggest the number of refugees will likely reach the millions. The federal government will step in to help local authorities. Considering the number of refugees and the resources we will require to host them we can expect the economy to be negatively impacted. There are also fears that tensions will rise between our population and the refugees. Regardless, the people of India must rise to the occasion and help the Bengalis suffering under military repression."
 IND_BENGAL.2.d:0 "The Indian government formally requested we act to help resolve the situation in East Pakistan. The Indians are pointing to the rising refugee crisis in Calcutta and the widely reported news of a brutal Pakistani military crackdown. The Indians suggest if a solution cannot be found, they may be forced to act and resolve the situation themselves. We have historically close ties with Pakistan and the State Department suggests we can put pressure on them. Our national media is widely reporting on the Pakistani crackdown and there is growing agitation for us to act and end the violence. However, the Pakistanis would likely view any effort by us negatively and it is generally not our policy to not intervene in the internal affairs of friendly states at the behest of other states."
 IND_BENGAL.3.d:0 "The United States recently dispatched a diplomatic delegation to Pakistan and urged its government to halt its ongoing military operations in East Pakistan. The Pakistani government publicly stated it appreciated American interest but privately reports indicate they are furious. The American effort is not likely to cause Pakistan to change its approach to the situation, but it indicates the rising international isolation Pakistan is facing with its ongoing operations. The Indian government released a statement in support of the American effort, fueling media reports in Pakistan accusing America and India colluding against the nation."
 IND_BENGAL.4.d:0 "The Indian government recently dispatched an emergency delegation to hold talks with us over the ongoing crisis in East Pakistan. The Indians expressed fears that if the situation deteriorated further it could lead to catastrophe across the region. They urged us to implement the Ahsan Formula as the best solution to end the crisis in a peaceful and honorable way. This was done privately as the Indians did not want to make it seem like they were forcing our hand and to give us political cover, which is appreciated. Senior military leaders and hawks are urging the President to reject what they see is Indian hegemony. However, some cabinet members believe the Ahsan Formula remains the best solution and we should implement it as soon as possible."
 IND_BENGAL.5.d:0 "We received a troubling ultimatum from the Indian government calling for us to immediately halt military operations and withdraw from so-called Bangladesh. The Indians call the operations a humanitarian crisis and incubator of human rights abuses that will boil over and lead to catastrophe across the region. They are giving us three months to implement the withdrawal, stating that a failure to do so may result in India taking whatever actions are necessary to end the violence. There are many who feel India is just blustering and have no intention of involving themselves militarily. Some other leaders believe even if India intervenes, the Pakistan nation is more than ready to offer a befitting reply. Privately, a few officials are urging the President to accept the ultimatum and cut our losses in East Pakistan. They say the sting of a withdrawal is much preferred to what they fear may end up being a military disaster."
