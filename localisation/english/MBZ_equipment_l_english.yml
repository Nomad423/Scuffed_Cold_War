 MBZ_infantry_equipment_1_desc:0 "The AK47 is a fully automatic assault rifle developed in the Soviet Union by Mikhail Kalashnikov in 1947, but was not introduced into active service until 1948 where the fixed-stock version was sent in for production. In early 1949, the AK47 was accepted by the Soviet Armed Forces for mass deployment into front-line units. With a long-stroke gas piston, a selector/safety, an automated trigger and chambering mechanism, and further improvements to overall design the AK47 was a vast upgrade to the SKS. The AK47 would, for many years, be considered to be one of the world's most reliable and easy to maintain, handle, and learn weapons in the world."

 MBZ_infantry_equipment_2_desc:0 "The AKM is a modernized variant of the AK47 that was developed by Mikhail Kalashnikov that was developed in the late 1950s and put into service with the Soviet Army in 1959. A great deal of the weapon was optimized and redesigned to suit the needs of the modernizing army. Many parts were simplified for mass production and the milled steel receiver was replaced with a u-shaped steel stamping to improve production rates. The weapon was also vastly lighter as a result of the simplifications reducing its weight. by ~30%. Additionally, the weapon was reinforced to make it stronger and added guide rails to improve the bolt carrier's movement. The AKM was immediately and ubiquitously used by many communist countries and manufactured for conflicts during its entire lifespan. Most notably the Invasion of Czechoslovakia, where it was used by both sides."

OKB-520 modified the T-55 design by improving NBC protection, giving it a more optimized engine, improving the turret shape, and even added more auxiliary equipment such as improved fire control and optics. Additionally, the T-55 used the 12.7 DShK HMG more often whereas the T-54 used the 7.62 SGMT gun, granting it more firepower but barring it from carrying more ammunition. The T-55 was used in just as many armies and typically saw all the conflicts that the T-54 saw. "

 MBZ_jet_multirole_equipment_2_desc:0 "Perhaps one of the most iconic fighters of the Cold War, the Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-15 Fagot entered service in 1947. The MiG-15 was involved in many conflicts since its introduction in the Korean War, where it proved a worthy adversary to the American F-86 Sabre and F9F Panther. A section of the Korean-Chinese border was nicknamed MiG Alley because of their prevalence in the area. Over 18 000 MiG-15s were built and used by many nations, most notably the USSR and Eastern Bloc nations. While most aircraft were decommissioned in the 1950's, some still remain in service with the North Korean Air Force."

In total 20 nations used the MiG-17, spanning Africa, Europe and Asia. Its first combat deployment was in 1958, when PRC MiGs clashed with Nationalist Chinese F-86 Sabres over the Taiwan Strait. However, the MiG-17 primarily saw use in the Vietnam war with the NVAF and PLAAF were it scored 28 aerial victories. The MiG-17 was so successful that it even held its own against the much more modern, supersonic American Phantom II fighters of the Vietnam war. The MiG-17 was generally decommissioned in the 1970's, while it still remains in limited service in some African nations and North Korea."
