The development of the M41 was progressing slowly with little funding but when the Korean War broke out, the US army began rushing the program. The rushing caused a large number of problems in the program and oversize issues. The M41, as a result of severe problems stemming from the rushing of the program, was produced for a very short time and did not see usage during the Korean war. In fact, production did not start until 1951 and only lasted 3 years."

Its twin-engine configuration gave it the informal nickname 'Twin Huey.'"
