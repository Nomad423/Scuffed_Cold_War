A great deal of the weapon was optimized and redesigned to suit the needs of the modernizing army. Many parts were simplified for mass production and the milled steel receiver was replaced with a u-shaped steel stamping to improve production rates. The weapon was also vastly lighter as a result of the simplifications reducing its weight. by ~30%. Additionally, the weapon was reinforced to make it stronger and added guide rails to improve the bolt carrier's movement. The AKM was immediately and ubiquitously used by many communist countries and manufactured for conflicts during its entire lifespan. Most notably the Invasion of Czechoslovakia, where it was used by both sides."

 CUB_infantry_equipment_3_desc:0 "The AK74 is a modern assault rifle developed by Mikhail Kalashnikov to replace the AKM in 1974. It uses a smaller cartridge and an improved chrome-lined bore with 4 right-hand grooves. The front sight and gas block were redesigned to contain a bas channel installed 90 degrees from the bore axis to reduce bullet shear at the port hold. In addition, its development came with a variety of attachments including a rubber padded stock. The AK74's improvements allowed soldiers to carry a greater amount of ammunition in the field and maintain a higher volume of fire at higher mid range accuracies. It saw expensive usage during the Afghanistan conflict where the CIA paid the Mujahideen a great sum of money to retrieve a captured AK74. The AK74 is used by civil authorities within the Cuban govenment."
