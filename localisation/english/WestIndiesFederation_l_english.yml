 wif.1.d:0 "The West Indies Federation came into existence today following the passage of the British Caribbean Federation Act. The new political union unites over twenty major islands and nearly two hundred and fifty smaller islands into ten provinces with a federal center. The British hope the Federation will be able to transition its now former colonial islands into a fully independent state. London sees the Federation as a way to respond to the increased pressure from subjects in the islands for independence while also ensuring independence will result in a viable state not dependent on London. Some residents, especially from the larger islands cautiously welcome this new state but express anxiety to questions of how centralized the Federation will be. A anti-colonial activist interviewed stated the Federation merely continued British exploitation and only immediate independence would end centuries of colonial oppression to the people of the islands. However, it appears the majority of people welcome the news and hope this will mark a new period of independence and development for the people."
