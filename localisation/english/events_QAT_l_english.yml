 Qatar_Pol.1.d:0 "Ali bin Abdullah Al Thani announced his abdication as the ruling Amir of Qatar. This comes months after his cousin attempted to assassinate him in Beirut. He came to power in 1949 and during his rule Qatar entered the oil industry and greatly expanded education facilities for its people. He also patronized Islamic literature, facilitating the publication of many works on Islam that had previously only had available to a select few. Recent years has seen his government challenged by the rising popularity of Arab Nationalism and increasing unrest among oil workers. Although he sought to mediate these issues, these tensions remain. He has selected his son Ahmed bin Ali Al Thani to take over and there is hope among many Qatari that the new, more youthful Amir will help continue the modernization of the nation."
 Qatar_Pol.4.d:0 "The new Amir of Qatar has indicated a desire to oversee reform and development in his nation. There is a recognition within the royal family and its supporters that to remain in power and satisfy the desires of its people it must change and reform. The Amir fears the current of new ideas sweeping the world and region may overwhelm the government if it is not prepared. To achieve this, the Amir requested the British government to provide a Political Advisor to help him as he begins his reign. The Political Advisor will offer support, facilitate aid to the nation and help direct the reform program effectively. This will also strengthen ties between Qatar and its patron, Britain."
 Qatar_Pol.2.d:0 "The influence of Arab Nationalism across the Arab World has infected the hearts of many in Qatar. They now believe strongly in pan-Arab ideas which undermine the government of Qatar and the royal family. The Amir in particular is aware of this threat and fears his decision to send Qataris abroad for education has resulted in many returning with this dangerous ideology. The British are also concerned as the strong anti-colonial underpinnings of the ideology threaten their relationship and presence in Qatar. Many in the government are advocating a strong approach to shutting down the threat. However, there is also a faction that argues an aggressive approach may radicalize the Arab nationalists and that accommodating them maybe the best approach."
 QAT_Suez_Crisis.1.d:0 "The recent Suez Crisis is enflaming passions among the people of Qatar. Many in the country view the British collaboration with Israel against the Arab people of Egypt as an imperialist plot to weaken the Arab World and enslave it to the West. Oil workers are particularly upset and have spearheaded street protests against the British. Considering the close relationship between the government and the British, there are increasing fears that these protests may escalate and challenge the government. However, the government must treat carefully as it does not want to be seen as being against the aspirations of Arabs or as a tool for the British."
 Qatar_Pol.3.d:0 "The Amir of Qatar called on the British military to intervene and restore order to the country. The unrest caused by the Suez Crisis has turned into protests against the government. Considering the popularity of Arab Nationalism, many in the government fear using the Qatari military risks having the troops join the protesters. It is believed British forces will be the most effective in these circumstances and they will preserve the government. The British are keen to help as they have invested heavily in the oil industry in Qatar and would not like to lose access to it, especially as it faces threats of embargoes due to the Suez Crisis."
 QAT_Arab_Federation.1.d:0 "The Amir of Qatar announced his proposal for a United Gulf Emirates which would unite all the British protectorates in the Arabian Gulf into one nation. This would see Qatar unite with Bahrain, Kuwait, the Trucial States, South Yemen, Aden, and Muscat. The Amir notes all these states face threats from regional powers and ideologies that threaten the existing political order. By uniting, they can all resist such challenges together and ensure the people under their rule will be able to prosper under stable governance. In addition, the threat from neighboring, larger states will be nullified. For the British, the proposed state will be strong enough to reduce the dependency on British military power and it can act as a powerful regional state to preserve their interests against the hostile states and ideologies currently proliferating. London has said it will consider the proposal."
 QAT_Arab_Federation.2.d:0 "The British government has announced in principle it accepts the recent proposal by the Amir of Qatar for a United Gulf Emirates. The British government noted current trends in the world indicate British colonies and protectorate in the regions will not be sustainable in the long-term. The United Gulf Emirates promises to combine all these interests into a strong, pro-British state. The British government notes this is the best approach to secure their influence in the region while reducing the costs and also respecting the aspirations of the people living in those states. The United Gulf Emirates will see Qatar unite with Kuwait, Bahrain, the Trucial States, South Yemen, Aden and Muscat. This action will also halt the decline of Britain in the region and the new state will be a great counter to the ideological threats in the region."
 QAT_Arab_Federation.3.d:0 "The British government announced it is declining the proposal by the Amir of Qatar to form a new nation called the United Gulf Emirates. This new state would have united Qatar with Kuwait, Bahrain, the Trucial States, South Yemen, Aden, and Kuwait. By unifying all British protectorates and colonies the Qataris hoped to convince London that this would be the best scenario for Britain as it faces the challenges of decolonization. The British government however, noted the proposal was too ambitious and unfeasible, stating it did not believe these multiple states and territories could be able to establish a unified government and would be ripe for instability. At the moment, the British believe the status quo is the best for all the peoples in the region and the nation of Britain."
 QAT_Arab_Federation.4.d:0 "During an elaborate ceremony in Qatar, the United Gulf Emirates signed their independence documents with British officials. The ceremony brought all the various political leaders of the new state and the senior British officials of the region. With this agreement, the former British protectorates and colonies of the Persian Gulf will be united as one. Many believe the British hope this new nation will satisfy the aspiration of the peoples in these lands but also preserve the relationship with Britain and these areas as the leaders were all kept in power by the British, some for many decades. The United Gulf Emirates itself believes its structure will allow its citizens to preserve their independence from regional powers and be a potent player in regional politics."
 QAT_Coronation.1.d:0 "The coronation of Sheikh Ali bin Abdullah Al Thani concluded in the capital today. The new, young Amir took over in an elaborate ceremony meant to showcase the prestige of Qatar. He takes over a nation undergoing major transformations, especially in its economy as the oil industry continues to grow and expand. However, this new growth has seen a rise in dissent, especially among supporters of Arab Nationalism and labor reform. This threat targets the government and the continued domination of the royal family on the affairs of the state. How the new Amir handles these challenges will remain to be seen. He has already pledged to continue the development and reform policies of his predecessor and promises to modernize Qatar and see it prosper in the coming years."

 QATAR_UAS.1.d:0 "The United Arab States today welcomed the oil rich nation of Qatar into its ranks. The government of Qatar recently embraced Arab Nationalism and brought many of its supporters within Qatar into positions of influence. For many this appears to be the next natural step as Qatar still needs help with technical training and a larger power to protect its independence after it expelled its former patron Britain. The top leadership of the UAR were in Qatar for a ceremony in which the Qatari government signed the agreement and the flags across the country were changed to the United Arab States flag. Although their was much joy in Qatar and the United Arab States, other regional states were quiet or condemned the decision of Qatar. Many stating this upset the balance of power within the Arab World."
 Mesaieed.1.d:0 "The government of Qatar announced the establishment of Mesaieed today. This settlement is setup next to the main oil facilities and is meant to be the industrial center of the rapidly growing oil industry in the country. It will be the main tanker terminal for Qatar and will be administrated by the petroleum company. The government hopes this new industrial city will help growth in the country as it is also located near the working class neighborhoods of the country. The close proximity will aid in job creation and career development for the citizens of Qatar."
 QATAR_UAR.1.d:0 "The Amir of Qatar is a surprise statement announced his public support for President Gamal Abdel Nasser. The Amir praised his vision for Arab unity and his struggle against imperialism during recent events. The news is being welcomed by many in Qatar who support Arab Nationalism. This support had led to street protests and unrest and many suspect the announcement is meant to appease Qataris. Whether the statement will completely satisfy the Arab Nationalist sympathizers, especially among the oil workers is unknown. Traditionalists and the established elite in Qatar are said to be uneasy by this statement, especially as it risks alienating relations with Britain and the west."
 QATAR_IND.1.d:0 "The Amir of Qatar has directed the government to end all engagement with British authorities as he announced the abrogation of all treaties with Britain. The Amir states this is in response to the unprovoked attack on Egypt by Britain and their efforts to curb the aspirations of Arabs. He added that Arab Nationalism offers a destiny for the entire Arab World which is what the British are fearful for and Qatar will no longer support this project. Arab Nationalist supporters and oil industry workers have received the news with joy as they have launched street protests against the government and its ties with Britain since the Suez Crisis began. Traditionalists close to the monarchy are noticeably uncomfortable and unsure about this latest announcement and fear the Amir maybe leading Qatar towards a disaster."
