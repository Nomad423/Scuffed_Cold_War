 Tashkent_Decleration.1.d:0 "The Soviet Union has graciously offered to host peace talks in Tashkent to help end our war with India. As we prepare for the conference, we must consider what occurred during the recent conflict. Although our forces did not achieve decisive results, the Pakistan military held it own against a much larger enemy, no doubt impressing the world. During the conflict, both us and the Indians gained and lost territory during the fighting. The Foreign Ministry suggests we press India to implement the UN resolutions during the peace talks. They must surely recognize this is the only way to prevent future conflict with us. Our top diplomats, however, suggest the Indians will not likely accept this and the most basic result we can hope for is a return to pre-war borders. Considering how our war propaganda talked of great victories, event that result may lead to great disappointment."
 Tashkent_Decleration.2.d:0 "The Soviet Union has graciously offered to host peace talks in Tashkent to help end our war with Pakistan. As we prepare for the conference, we must consider what has occurred. Our excellent armed forces successfully thwarted the Pakistani plot to seize Kashmir from us. Our forces then proceeded to punish the Pakistanis across their borders. Although we made gains, we also lost some territory to Pakistan. However, our top diplomats believe we achieved our goal of not losing Kashmir and we can likely negotiate a return to prewar boundaries. The Pakistanis are likely to push for a resolution to the Kashmir problem, however, they are not in a position to demand the territory or that we implement the UN resolution. The cabinet urges the Prime Minister not to cave to potential Pakistani pressures."
 Tashkent_Decleration.3.d:0 "The recently concluded conflict with India has highlighted the anxiety and fears among many Bengalis in Pakistan. They felt the fighting in Kashmir occurred without consultation and resulted in a war that put East Pakistan in grave danger. In addition, many Bengalis felt the government focused its resources and troops on the Kashmir front, leaving the largest populated province of Pakistan vulnerable to enemy incursions. Bengali politicians and student leaders have addressed large crowds of protestors angry at what they felt was a failure of the military to protect them."
 Tashkent_Decleration.4.d:0 "The Soviet government is hosting the leaders of India and Pakistan in Tashkent for talks. The purpose of these talks is to reach a final agreement to end the recent war fought between the two South Asian powers. The war began when Pakistan attempted to de-freeze the current situation in Kashmir, this led to a military escalation that culminated into open war. The Pakistani leadership will be pushing for a settlement on Kashmir, preferably the implementation of previous UN resolutions on the issue. However, experts believe the Indian government will likely reject such pressures and instead press to make the pre-war ceasefire line the permanent border. Many analysts believe the conflict on the ground was largely inconclusive and it would be surprising if either party could convince the other. For the Soviets, the meeting gives them a chance to demonstrate their claim of being a neutral or friendly world power to the newly emerging post-colonial states."
 Tashkent_Decleration.5.d:0 "The initial talks proved inconclusive, but following Soviet guidance, the Pakistani President and our Prime Minister to meet privately to discuss options for peace. During their talk, the Pakistani leader pressed us to implement the UN resolution on Kashmir and let the UN conduct a plebiscite. He stated that a failure to do so would only allow the conflict to fester and alienate the Kashmiris. After these talks, the Prime Minister discussed with his advisors. The consensus was that we remain firmly in control of our portion of Kashmir and should not legitimize Pakistani aggression by agreeing. Instead they stated we can offer to make the pre-war Kashmir cease fire line the permanent border. The Prime Minister heard these comments and must now decide whether he will go out on a limb and accept the Pakistani position or counter the offer."
 Tashkent_Decleration.6.d:0 "Against all his advisors, the Prime Minister announced his intentions to agree with Pakistan and implement UN resolution 47 on Kashmir. He stated that though the decision will not be popular at home, it will cement India as a mature power and be viewed positively in time. He added the people of Kashmir may see the Indian decision as positive and this may make the vote end in our favor. The Pakistani delegation and the Soviet mediators were thrilled by this decision. The initial reaction from the media has been largely negative. Many opposition politicians and editorials are already lambasting the government for surrendering to Pakistani aggression, with some even calling for the government to resign. Despite this uproar, the Prime Minister remains committed to his decision."
 Tashkent_Decleration.7.d:0 "The international community was surprised to learn that India has agreed to approach the United Nations to implement resolution 47 and hold a plebiscite in Kashmir to determine its final status. Pakistan has long pushed for India to take this action and the recent war was largely fought to force a resolution on Kashmir. Although the military conflict ended inconclusively for Pakistan and many analysts predicted India would seek to restore the pre-war status quo. The United Nations have welcomed the decision, while nations across the globe are praising India for its statesmanship and desire for lasting peace in South Asia. The Pakistani government could barely conceal its glee over the announcement. The reaction in India has largely been of anger and shock at what many are calling a betrayal. To many Indians, they feel the decision is a concession to Pakistani military aggression."
 Tashkent_Decleration.8.d:0 "The Indian Prime Minister informed us of his decision to implement the UN resolution on Kashmir. This marks the completion of our primary foreign policy objective since independence. We have long felt the need to de-freeze Kashmir, which pushed our recent actions. The Indian decision confirms that our actions were just, and the people of Kashmir will finally achieve their true rights after years of struggle. The initial reaction of the media and leading politicians has been largely positive. As news spreads, we can expect jubilant crowds. This achievement is a testament to the hard work and sacrifices of our armed forces in the recent struggle. We have truly emerged as a leading power in the region and the world."
 Tashkent_Decleration.9.d:0 "We tried to press India hard on taking this moment to implement the UN resolutions on Kashmir. We hoped they would see from our actions and resolve that as long as Kashmir remained uncertain, there was no possibility of future peace. Instead, the Indian Prime Minister informed us that he agreed Kashmir should be resolved but the solution was not to surrender the decision to a foreign body like the UN. Instead, he suggested the pre-war Kashmir borders be restored and made permanent. This is a big blow to our cause and the consensus is to reject the proposal outright. However, the President must consider whether accepting the permanent border, and the negative consequences are worth the benefits of normalizing relations and establishing peace and prosperity in the region."
 Tashkent_Decleration.10.d:0 "The Pakistani President, much to the chagrin of his advisors, stated his acceptance at making the Kashmir border permanent. In his comments, he noted this was done out of a desire for permanent peace for the people of Pakistan, India, and Kashmir. Our delegation, along with the Soviet mediators were jubilant with the decision and word is already spreading back home at our success. We are already receiving congratulations from opposition leaders over the success in Tashkent. We have decisively proven that naked aggression cannot lead to success and our armed forces sacrifices were for the greater good."
 Tashkent_Decleration.11.d:0 "The reaction in Pakistan to the news in Kashmir has largely been one of disgust and outrage. During the recent conflict, the media portrayed Pakistan as achieving great military successes. Many are dumbfounded that after such supposed victories, how could the President surrender Kashmir. Many are claiming the battlefield victories have been surrendered in the peace talks. Already there are calls for solidarity marches for Kashmir to be held. Some members of the cabinet are expected to resign in protest, there are rumors of discontent within the ranks of the military as well. Regardless, the President remains firm and in a brief statement, mentioned the decision will lead to peace and open a path for Kashmiri families to be reunited."
 Tashkent_Decleration.12.d:0 "In a surprise breakthrough in Tashkent, the Soviet government announced Pakistan and India had reached an agreement on Kashmir. Both sides agreed to return to pre-war borders and make the original ceasefire line the permanent border. The news is being well-received internationally, with many praising the Pakistani government specifically for recognizing the situation astutely and achieving a permanent breakthrough. The recent war fought between both states largely occurred over fighting in Kashmir. Though the fighting remained inconclusive, it appears the Pakistani and Indian leadership were interested in firmly solving the crisis. The Indian population is reacting positively to the news, although initial reports from Pakistan suggest backlash at the agreement."
 Tashkent_Decleration.13.d:0 "The Pakistani delegation flatly rejected our suggestion on making the Kashmir border permanent. Instead they reiterated their desire to implement the UN resolutions. It is clear that they are not willing to budge but are also not positioned to continue the fighting. We obviously cannot consider the Pakistani stance. Both us and the Pakistanis are facing intense pressure from the Soviet mediators to stabilize the situation. With the military situation ended inconclusively, it appears the only option left is to insist a return to the pre-war borders. Such a solution is not ideal, but will confirm that we succeeded in thwarting Pakistani aggression on Kashmir."
 Tashkent_Decleration.14.d:0 "It is clear the Indians are not willing to budge or be realistic on a solution to Kashmir. In addition, we are facing immense pressure from the Soviets to wrap up the talks and agree to a solution that ends the recent conflict. The Indians have stated they will accept a return to pre-war borders and exchange of POWs. This is not the scenario we wanted, but given the situation, we do not have a choice. Our people must be satisfied with the result that despite facing such a large enemy, our brave military was able to prevent them from achieving a decisive victory."
 Tashkent_Decleration.15.d:0 "Foreign Minister Zulfiqar Bhutto, one of the more outspoken hawks within the government has reacted very negatively to the final agreement. He believes India will now act to make their occupation of Kashmir permanent and we should have continued the struggle. His loud denunciations are irritating to the President and it is likely that his days within the government are numbered. Privately, many within the cabinet believe Bhutto was instrumental in pushing the military to act on Kashmir and this action has led the government into the present situation."
 Tashkent_Decleration.16.d:0 "With smiles from Soviet mediators, the Pakistani and Indian leaders signed the Tashkent Agreement. The treaty stipulates both sides will withdraw their forces to their pre-war borders. The agreement also pledges both sides to exchange POWs from the recent conflict. In regard to Kashmir, the agreement stipulated both nations would continue to work on finding an eventual solution. Though the Pakistanis did not achieve a permanent solution on Kashmir. India wanted language which pledged both sides to find a solution only through peaceful means, but Pakistan was able to make the language much vaguer. Overall, the agreement confirms the inconclusive nature of the conflict."
 Tashkent_Decleration.17.d:0 "After a week of negotiations in Tashkent, under Soviet mediation, Pakistan and India reached a final agreement. The Tashkent Agreement calls on a return to pre-war boundaries and exchange of POWs. Hopes for a final solution on Kashmir were not achieved as the agreement only urges both nations to continue talks. The agreement largely confirms the recent conflict was militarily inconclusive. The Indian delegation will likely be satisfied with the outcome, though the Pakistani delegation will likely face backlash. The international community has welcomed the agreement, hoping the restoration of peace in the region will pave the way for a future solution."
 Tashkent_Decleration.18.d:0 "In a stunning development from Tashkent, news reached that Prime Minister Shastri suddenly passed away soon after signing the agreement. Initial reports suggest he passed away from a heart attack. The Indian delegation and parliament are said to be stunned by the news. Prime Minister Shastri, known for his humbleness and quiet devotion to the Indian nation, had led the country ably during the recent war with Pakistan. The Pakistani President was said to be shaken by the news and helped carry his body to the plane returning him home for a proper funeral. Despite his death, the Tashkent Agreement and its implementation is not expected to be changed."

 Treaty_Lahore.1.d:0 "We must prepare for negotiations with the Indian government in Lahore. The recent war with India ended with us achieving a strong military position. Through the grace of God, our armed forces achieved its objectives in Kashmir and along the border. The Indian military was unable to seize our major cities and suffered severe setbacks in Kashmir and elsewhere. Following the ceasefire, it was clear we are in a strong position to dictate terms to the Indians. Many in the cabinet are advocating we use our success to force India into settling Kashmir. We launched our operations in order to de-freeze Kashmir and have largely succeeded in our plans. Now is the time to press our claims."
 Treaty_Lahore.2.d:0 "We must prepare for negotiations with the Pakistani government in Lahore. The recent war with Pakistan did not go as we had hoped. Our forces suffered major setbacks in Kashmir and along the wider border. We failed to capture any valuable cities from Pakistan and cannot use that as a bargaining chip in the talks. It is clear the Pakistanis will press us on Kashmir and demand we vacate the province. Our best approach will be to push for the implementation of UN resolution 47. Ironically a reversal of our previous policy, if Pakistan instead pushes for us to vacate the province, we can then offer a partition plan that would allow us to hold on to Ladakh and Jammu. We must try our best in the upcoming talks to achieve an honorable result."
 Treaty_Lahore.3.d:0 "The Bengalis in East Pakistan have long harbored suspicions of being second-class citizens or being overlooked by the federal government. This despite their large population, huge economic role, and historical devotion to the Pakistan Movement. When war initially broke out over Kashmir, rumors spread that West Pakistan had abandoned East Pakistan. However, as the Pakistan military began achieving military victories, those apprehensions soon dissolved. The Bengali press praised the military successes, while the military and federal government offered their admiration to the support and sacrifices made by the people of East Pakistan. With the war over and peace talks about to commence, Bengali patriotism towards Pakistan appears renewed. To reciprocate this new feeling of unity, the Pakistan government announced the inclusion of a prominent Bengali provincial leader as part of the Pakistani negotiating team for the Lahore talks."
 Treaty_Lahore.4.d:0 "The Indian delegation, headed by their Prime Minister, recently arrived in Lahore for talks on ending the recent South Asian war. The press noted none of the Indian representatives appeared anything but serious over their mission. Before arriving, the Indian Prime Minister informed his nation  that he was going to negotiate with Pakistan in the hopes of securing a just peace, the return of occupied Indian lands and soldiers being held as POWs. The Pakistani President and his delegation are already in Lahore, formal talks will begin in the next couple days. Although the Pakistani press had been noisily boasting over the successful position Pakistan is in, the government recently requested such writings be temporarily halted to facilitate a friendly atmosphere for the peace talks."
 Treaty_Lahore.5.d:0 "During the initial talks, we told the Indians our principle objective was to establish a final peace in Kashmir. As we are in a militarily dominant position in Kashmir and along the border, we certainly have the advantage. However, the Indians surprised our delegation by offering to implement UN resolution 47 on Kashmir, as we had demanded for years. They say now is the moment for both of our nations to step back and let the Kashmiri people choose their destiny. Certainly, this is what we have always wanted, but our position is such that we can simply demand India vacate Kashmir and not risk an international vote, which could potentially be interfered with by the Indians. We may never have such a strong negotiating position ever again and leaving it to the UN may backfire. However, accepting the Indian offer and then gaining Kashmir through a UN vote would make our success more legitimate internationally."
 Treaty_Lahore.6.d:0 "In a surprising change of events, the Pakistani government accepted our offer to implement UN resolution 47. This result will leave the future of Kashmir to its residents and they may potentially choose to join us, though it appears unlikely. Regardless, this is a far more favorable result than being asked to completely vacate Kashmir. With this agreement, we can expect a return to pre-war borders on the international border along with a prisoner exchange, once we commit to the United Nations route. Rumors of the agreement are being well-received by the Indian press, with many seeing this result as far more palatable than the alternative."
 Treaty_Lahore.7.d:0 "The Pakistani President addressed the nation with regards to peace talks in Lahore. He stated the Indian government had offered to wholly commit itself to implementing UN resolutions on Kashmir. He stated that empowering the people of Kashmir is the only modest desire of the people of Pakistan. The UN resolution will pave the way for Kashmiris to decide once and for all which nation they wish to join. The English press in Pakistan is praising the President for achieving Pakistani objectives in a way that does not humiliate India and preserve the international standing of the nation. The Urdu press, however, is much more scathing, accusing the government of picking international image over using their position of strength to force India out. For them, the Indians had years to implement the resolution but chose not to, they should have been humbled. There are also rumors within the military expressing disappointment that battlefield victories were not converted to a more concrete victory."
 Treaty_Lahore.8.d:0 "The world reacted positively to news that Pakistan and India had agreed to implement UN resolutions on Kashmir to establish a final resolution to the disputed territory. Indeed, the recent war fought between the two sides was over who controlled Kashmir. India was forced to offer the implementation of the resolutions as the military conflict left them in a very weak position. Because of this, the agreement surprised some observers who thought Pakistan would simply use its position to force India out of Kashmir and take it for itself. It appears the Pakistanis are working to not force a peace that would provoke further animosity from India or give an international image of Pakistan as a militarily aggressive power. It is also clear the Pakistanis were confident the vote will give Kashmir to them."
 Treaty_Lahore.9.d:0 "The Pakistani government responded coldly to our offer to implement the UN resolution. They noted this was something we could have done years ago and to offer it now, with the current situation, it was a disingenuous way for them to save face. The Pakistanis instead stated that the Indian situation in Kashmir was clearly untenable and India should vacate the former Princely State. The Pakistanis softened this hardline stance by adding that if we comply, they will immediately restore the international border to the pre-war borders and exchange POWs. Certainly we cannot permanently accept the occupation of major Indian cities. However, some advisors suggest we offer the Pakistanis a partition plan for Kashmir in which we retain Jammu and Ladakh, this would allow each part of Kashmir to be with their co-religionists."
 Treaty_Lahore.10.d:0 "After we informed the Indians our intention was not to play games with regards to Kashmir, they made an intriguing offer. The Indians noted that historically Jammu was non-Muslim and the First Kashmir War drove many non-Muslims from the Valley to Jammu. That population would be apprehensive to a Pakistani government and to prevent animosity or a new cycle of communal unrest, perhaps we should partition Kashmir. They would give us all of Kashmir except for Jammu and Ladakh. Accepting this Partition Plan would achieve our goal of controlling the Valley and remove the potential headache of integrating Kashmiri non-Muslims. It would also avoid us inheriting the Indian border dispute with China. We should consider the option, however, some of the more hawkish delegates believe we should secure all of Kashmir and finally make Pakistan whole."
 Treaty_Lahore.11.d:0 "The Pakistanis have revealed their naked ambitions by rejecting our latest partition proposal on Kashmir. The Pakistanis have stated they will withdraw their forces from our territory and exchange POWs once our forces begin their evacuation from Kashmir. Our situation is untenable, the longer Pakistani forces occupy our lands the weaker the state and government look. Though it pains us, we have no choice but comply and sign the agreement. The military and population will no doubt be furious by this change of events. The Pakistanis are thinking very short sighted, though they may succeed now, the people of India will never abandon those Kashmiris we have protected since 1947."
 Treaty_Lahore.12.d:0 "The Pakistani government, after taking time to consider our proposal, have agreed to partition Kashmir. We immediately gave orders for our forces to withdraw to the new borders. The final agreement will see both of our nations return to the international pre-war borders and begin the process of exchanging prisoners. Although our people and the opposition will be disappointed with the result, we can at least argue that we have preserved our commitment to the victims of the initial tribal invasion of Kashmir. Given a bad situation, we have come up as well as could be expected."
 Treaty_Lahore.13.d:0 "The international community was pleased to see that Pakistan and India agreed on a final agreement to end their recent war in Lahore. After intense negotiations, Pakistan agreed to partition Kashmir with India. The Kashmir Valley and the territory already controlled by Pakistan will be under its control. India retains its control of Ladakh and Jammu. Both sides agreed this solution would allow all Kashmiris to reside where they are most comfortable. Despite this, there are already reports of non-Muslim Kashmiris moving to Jammu and India. This agreement marks a major setback for India and confirms their military defeat on the battlefield. For Pakistan, their government is celebrating the treaty as the completion of the nation. Plans are already underway for the President to visit Srinagar."
 Treaty_Lahore.14.d:0 "The President of Pakistan and Prime Minister of India signed the Treaty of Lahore to end their recent military conflict. The agreement confirms the Pakistani military victory as India agreed to withdraw completely from Kashmir. In exchange, both sides will return to pre-war borders along the international border and exchange POWs. The reaction in Pakistan has been complete jubilation. Mosques are proclaiming the details of the treaty, causing crowds to gather in celebration. In India, the treaty is being viewed as the ultimate humiliation. Reports are already arriving of non-Muslim Kashmiris fleeing to India, their arrival will only emphasize what was lost. Many observers believe despite the Pakistani victory, the situation between the two nations will not likely improve with this agreement."
 Treaty_Lahore.15.d:0 "The Treaty of Lahore is being very negatively received in India. The opposition has been especially brutal in their criticism of the government in its handling of the war and its aftermath. There are reports of unrest among junior officers who feel the senior leadership and government failed the cause. There are some reports of civilians verbally abusing men in uniform and government officials. Of more concern is the arrival of pro-Indian Kashmiri refugees, their leaders are already publishing condemning editorials in major newspapers. We must work hard to reunite the nation and prepare for the future. Pakistan certainly had the upper hand this time, but we will no doubt eventually find our moment to strike."
 
 Treaty_Delhi.1.d:0 "The recent conflict with India ended disastrously. We not only failed to force India into resolving Kashmir but in the course of the conflict we now have Pakistani cities under Indian occupation. Militarily we have very little leverage. The people of Pakistan want their families united and their soldiers back home. However, it is clear the cost for this maybe at the expense of Kashmir. As our delegation prepares for Delhi, we must seek for a ceasefire and restoration of the pre-war status quo. If this fails, we will press for a partition of Kashmir with us retaining Gilgit-Baltistan. We will try to make that the permanent border to salvage at least something from the situation. However, the military situation is such that if India presses for us to vacate Kashmir, we will likely have no choice."
 Treaty_Delhi.2.d:0 "The recent conflict escalated only after Pakistan launched a devious campaign of violence in Kashmir. Their efforts to forcibly seize the territory failed and in the resulting war our forces have proven superior. We have the military advantage and control enough territory to negotiate from a position of strength. Many of the hawks within the government will put pressure on us to demand all of Kashmir, including Gilgit-Baltistan. While this certainly makes sense, we have to consider the challenges in incorporating so much land and a population brainwashed for decades to hate our nation. It may be better to consider alternative plans but not squander the advantage our brave men secured for us on the battlefield."
 Treaty_Delhi.3.d:0 "The recently concluded conflict with India has highlighted the anxiety and fears among many Bengalis in Pakistan. They felt the fighting in Kashmir occurred without consultation and resulted in a war that put East Pakistan in grave danger. In addition, many Bengalis felt the government focused its resources and troops on the Kashmir front, leaving the largest populated province of Pakistan vulnerable to enemy incursions. Bengali politicians and student leaders have addressed large crowds of protestors angry at what they felt was a failure of the military to protect them."
 Treaty_Delhi.4.d:0 "The initial talks between us and Pakistan were very tense. During the most recent discussions they offered to return the region to the pre-war situation of one month before fighting began in Kashmir. They state this will preserve the delicate status quo of Kashmir and prevent further enflaming of emotions on both sides of the border. Obviously, this is a desperate ploy by the Pakistanis, we will soon inform the Pakistanis that it was they who upset the status quo. Because of this they must recognize the new reality on the ground, as such we will state that Pakistan must cede all of its occupied Kashmir to us. The Kashmir Princely State acceded to India and Pakistan must recognize this reality."
 Treaty_Delhi.5.d:0 "Our efforts at trying to restore the pre-war borders was soundly rejected. The Indians are in no mood to consider this. They feel like we caused the unrest and they cannot stop until they get something from us. Our next option is to trade our claim to the Kashmir Valley for a restoration of peace. We will propose a partition for Kashmir where we retain Gilgit and Baltistan but cede the rest to India. We have been defeated this time, but we will recover and never abandon Kashmir."
 Treaty_Delhi.6.d:0 "The Pakistani delegation has realized we are not in a mood to let them off the hook. In the latest rounds of talk they have offered to cede their so-called Azad Kashmir to us but asked to retain Gilgit-Baltistan. During the First Kashmir War, Gilgit-Baltistan quickly fell to the Pakistanis as they had the support of local militia forces there. Their proposal may make a great deal of sense for us. We would avoid inheriting a hostile population and succeed in uniting the Kashmir Valley. Internationally it would also be a welcomed outcome. However, many of our hawks are saying we cannot lose this advantage and we should press the Pakistanis to leave Kashmir."
 Treaty_Delhi.7.d:0 "The Indian government has accepted our proposal on partitioning Kashmir. With a heavy heart, we have already given orders for our officials and remaining troops to leave Azad Kashmir. Already there are reports of Kashmiri families fleeing to safety in Pakistan. However, considering the alternative, this was the best result. We will never abandon Kashmir however, our hands are tied. The Indian government has agreed to withdraw their own forces from our territory and exchange POWs and restore diplomatic ties. We can only pray the future will give us an opportunity to right this historical injustice."
 Treaty_Delhi.8.d:0 "News of our agreement in Delhi have led to mass agitation across our cities. There is genuine shock as many Pakistanis were under the impression our forces were doing well in the war. The early arrival of refugees from Azad Kashmir is fueling the anger. Within the military, there is rumors of tension between senior officers and their subordinates. Many young officers felt the military setbacks were due not to Indian superiority but a failure of leadership. We must work to reunite our people in this moment of crisis."
 Treaty_Delhi.9.d:0 "News reached the wider public of our agreement on Kashmir. Many in the country are jubilant with the result. They see the agreement as a confirmation of our military dominance of the region and a just punishment to the Pakistanis. In regards to Kashmir, many newspapers argue uniting the Kashmir Valley will unite families and reduce tensions among the Kashmiris. The military is being widely cheered for preserving the honor of the nation. With this victory, we hope to finally see a new era of peace."
 Treaty_Delhi.10.d:0 "The negotiations in Delhi between India and Pakistan ended in an agreement. Pakistan agreed to cede the Kashmir valley to India, in exchange for a restoration of the pre-war international borders. The two sides also agreed to exchange POWs. Allowing Pakistan to retain Gilgit-Baltistan is being seen as a positive step by many observers. As the two sides withdraw their forces from the front, there are reports of Kashmiri refugees moving to Pakistan. The Indian population is said to be jubilant over the treaty, viewing it as confirmation of their military victory. The reaction in Pakistan is shock and anger, many feel the government completely failed the people of Kashmir."
 Treaty_Delhi.11.d:0 "The Indian delegation revealed their greediness and ambition by rejecting our just offer for a partition in Kashmir. The Indians stated the only scenario they will accept for a restoration of the international border and peace is our complete withdrawal from Kashmir. Due to the military balance, we are left with no choice but to comply. With a heavy heart, we must order our forces out of Kashmir. The consequences and backlash will be immense from the people. However, we have no choice, but considering the injustice of the situation, in time, we will be redeemed. Our delegates will soon sign the final treaty."
 Treaty_Delhi.12.d:0 "News of our agreement in Delhi have led to mass agitation across our cities. There is genuine shock as many Pakistanis were under the impression our forces were doing well in the war. The early arrival of refugees from Azad Kashmir is fueling the anger. Within the military, there is rumors of tension between senior officers and their subordinates. Many young officers felt the military setbacks were due not to Indian superiority but a failure of leadership. We must work to reunite our people in this moment of crisis. Our supporters now under Indian occupation will remain committed to us in their hearts."
 Treaty_Delhi.13.d:0 "News reached the wider public of our agreement on Kashmir. Many in the country are jubilant with the result. They see the agreement as a confirmation of our military dominance of the region and a just punishment to the Pakistanis. In regards to Kashmir, many newspapers argue uniting Kashmir Valley will unite families and reduce tensions among the Kashmiris. The new borders will also limit Chinese contat with Pakistan, furthering our position. The military is being widely cheered for preserving the honor of the nation. With this victory, we hope to finally see a new era of peace."
 Treaty_Delhi.14.d:0 "The negotiations in Delhi between India and Pakistan ended in an agreement. Pakistan agreed to cede all of its Kashmiri territory to India, in exchange for a restoration of the pre-war international borders. The two sides also agreed to exchange POWs. Some observers have expressed concern that taking all of Kashmir will only cement the antagonism between India and Pakistan. As the two sides withdraw their forces from the front, there are reports of Kashmiri refugees moving to Pakistan. The Indian population is said to be jubilant over the treaty, viewing it as confirmation of their military victory. The reaction in Pakistan is shock and anger, many feel the government completely failed the people of Kashmir."
 
 
 kashmiri_plebiscite:0 "UN Resolution 47: Kashmiri Plebiscite"
 kashmiri_plebiscite_desc:0 "India and Pakistan have occupied the former Princely State of Kashmir. Both claim the entire state, fighting a brief war weeks after Partition. Recently, both sides agreed to implement United Nations Security Council resolutions on the territory to hold a plebiscite. In the coming weeks, the people of Kashmir will determine their future and vote to join either India or Pakistan. Both governments are heavily involved in campaigning to convince the Kashmiri people their future lies with their state. The UN will administer a fair election."
