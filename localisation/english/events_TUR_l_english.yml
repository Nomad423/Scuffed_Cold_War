 TUR_1950_ELECTIONS.0.d:0 "The Turkish Republic is holding its second multiparty general election. The ruling Republican Party, known as CHP, is led by the trusted confidant of Ataturk, Ismet Inonu. His party promises a continuation of the protectionist, state led economy. In foreign policy the Republicans promise to maintain Turkish sovereignty while managing an increasingly dangerous regional situation. The Democratic Party, led by Adnan Menderes wishes to privatize and jumpstart the Turkish economy. They also seek closer ties with the West and some of its members believe in restoring some Islamic practices, while maintaining secularism. There is a feeling among many Turks that this maybe the time to give another party a chance after decades of CHP one-party rule."
 TUR_1950_ELECTIONS.1.d:0 "Against many predictions, the Republican Party (CHP) emerged victorious in the general election. President Ismet Inonu will stay at the helm for another term. Many urban and liberal Turks are said to be upset with the result and there are rumors of ballot stuffing. The Democratic Party has also raised its concerns over the results. Regardless, the military is satisfied as many officers were suspicious of the Democratic Party, despite their claims to secularism and Kemalism. It appears the traditional buereacratic-military ruling elite remains firmly in power. To the international community, it appears the Turkish people wish to maintain their political and economic path."
 CHP_1950.1.d:0 "Since the election, there have been testy exchanges during Grand National Assembly debates between the government and Democratic Party opposition. Although the Democratic Party is not openly calling the election results fraudulent, it is clear they are not denying it, fanning public suspicion, especially in liberal circles. The government must address this tension if it is to maintain stability and carry out its legislative agenda. The military and intelligence chiefs have offered to privately talk with opposition leaders and activists questioning the results. However, some in the CHP believe it would be better to simply hold direct talks with senior opposition leaders."
 CHP_1950.2.d:0 "The military and intelligence operations to bring the opposition in line has been a resounding success. Through coercion, threats, and gifts, many opposition leaders are now being much more cooperative and silent on the issue of electoral fraud. Activists, especially on university campuses have similarly been dealt with, the government can now conduct its legislative agenda more smoothly. The senior leaders of the CHP were purposely kept in the dark about what exactly was done to make the opposition compliant."
 CHP_1950.3.d:0 "Attempts by the military and opposition to bring about more cooperation and end discussions of electoral fraud among the Democratic Party opposition has backfired. Rumors quickly spread of opposition leaders being taken in the night to military bases or meeting with powerful intelligence officers. This blatant attempt to control the opposition is widely known and has only emboldened the opposition in the Grand National Assembly. Its members are no longer fearful of reprisals as the CHP cannot risk taking action without provoking public fervor or even largescale protests."
 CHP_1950.4.d:0 "The CHP recently concluded talks with the Democratic Party leadership over the current tensions and issues in the Grand National Assembly. A frank exchange of views was held and we were able to offer the opposition some assurances on certain procedures and legislation. In return, the opposition stated it would curb its members from meeting with or encouraging those who believe the elections were rigged in favor of the government."
 CHP_1950.5.d:0 "The CHP recently concluded talks with the Democratic Party leadership over the current tensions and issues in the Grand National Assembly. A frank exchange of views was held but they ultimately did not lead to any breakthrough. The opposition viewed the talks as a sign of weakness from the government and made certain demands on the legislation. Efforts to find a compromise in exchange for the opposition helping to stop rumors of a rigged election failed as the opposition stated none of its members were involved in such rumors. We can expect a more emboldened opposition in the Assembly."
 TUR_1950_ELECTIONS.2.d:0 "The Democratic Party has won a resounding victory in the election. Turkish President Ismet Inonu already promised a peaceful transition of power, ending rumors of a military coup or CHP-sponsored uprising. Adnan Menderes is expected to lead the party and government as Prime Minister, leaving the Presidency to Celal Bayar. The new government brings an infusion of commercial and business leaders, spreading political power beyond the traditional bureaucratic-military base. The military will likely view the government with suspicion as it promises to accelerate Turkish economic development through privatization and foreign cash."
 DP_1950.1.d:0 "The Turkish Prime Minister recently arrived in the United States to hold talks with the American government. The United States has prioritized relations with Turkey and views it as a key frontline state to global capitalism. The Turkish government has its own objectives, the ruling Democratic Party has promised to fuel economic growth through a free market economy. The military is requesting we ask for more military aid while political advisors want more economic aid to help push economic growth. Another option is to request a military and economic package, though the aid would be more limited in that case."
 DP_1950.2.d:0 "The Turkish Prime Minister is visiting the United States and has requested more military aid from our government. In particular, the Turkish Army would like more infantry equipment to modernize its forces. The Pentagon believes it can meet the request and the State Department believes such support would strengthen the Turkish government domestically. More importantly, it would demonstrate the closeness of our ties and show how our government supports those facing the communist threat straight on. However, there are some in the White House who question the need to provide such a large amount of aid to a country we already support heavily."
 DP_1950.3.d:0 "The Turkish Prime Minister is visiting the United States and has requested more economic aid from our government. In particular, the Turkish Prime Minister would like an influx of cash to boost the government efforts at transforming Turkey into a free market economy. The State Department believes such support would strengthen the Turkish government domestically. More importantly, it would demonstrate the closeness of our ties and show how our government supports those facing the communist threat straight on. However, there are some in the White House who question an influx of cash, especially as there are concerns it could help fuel an inflation crisis."
 DP_1950.4.d:0 "The Turkish Prime Minister is visiting the United States and has requested more military aid from our government. In particular, the Turkish Army would like more infantry equipment to modernize its forces. The Pentagon believes it can meet the request and the State Department believes such support would strengthen the Turkish government domestically. More importantly, it would demonstrate the closeness of our ties and show how our government supports those facing the communist threat straight on. However, there are some in the White House who question the need to provide such a large amount of aid to a country we already support heavily."
 DP_1950.5.d:0 "The recent trip to the United States was a failure for the Turkish Prime Minister. Although the two sides did agree to continue building relations, no new agreement on further aid was reached. This undermines the claims by the government that it could expand American ties for the benefit of Turkey. The military is said to be upset and the Finance Minister warns the lack of an agreement is raising uncertainty in the market. The United States is still very interested in its ties with Turkey, but it clearly has a limit to what it will provide."
 DP_1950.6.d:0 "The influx of foreign cash, government spending, and the cash brought in from privatization have caused inflation to increase and raise concerns that the economy is overheating. Some economic advisors warn the current pace of privatization and government influxes of cash to spur the market could lead to massive problems in the future. They suggest we launch structural reforms and cool things down. However, we have other economists who argue to slow down now would cripple economic growth and we should continue our spending as the country is on the verge of dramatic economic growth."
 TUR_1950_ELECTIONS.3.d:0 "The Republic of Turkey is holding general elections. The people must choose between the Republican Party (CHP) or the Democratic Party (DP). The CHP promises to continue the protectionist, state guided development along with a strong commitment to the traditional republican values such as secularism and Kemalism. The DP promises to facilitate privatization and use government funding to spur a free market economy. It also believes in committing to secularism. The DP also wishes to expand Turkey internationally and expand ties with the West. The powerful military is said to be suspicious of the DP as its membership consists of suspected Islamists and economic elites who threaten the powerful bureaucratic-military elite. The CHP has ruled for decades and many observers believe the Turkish people may lean towards the DP, but that will remain to be seen."
 TUR_1950_ELECTIONS.4.d:0 "Against many pre-election predictions, the Republican Party (CHP) won the recent elections handedly. Its leadership sees the victory as proof that the Turkish people are not willing to dramatically shift from the vision and economic policies of the early republic. The military is particularly thrilled as many CHP leaders are former officers. The opposition is said to be furious and is privately accusing the CHP of rigging the election but they cannot openly express their displeasure without risking legal issues. However, the rumors they spread will raise suspicion, especially in liberal circles and university campuses. Regardless, the CHP looks forward to implementing its vision for the Turkish republic."
 CHP_1954.1.d:0 "The recent election has spurred displeasure among segments in the public and the opposition that the elections were rigged or manipulated either by the CHP or military. The opposition is using delaying tactics and poisoning the atmosphere at the Grand National Assembly, making efforts to pass legislation time consuming or unpleasant. Some of our members reached out to the opposition and they have shown an interest in a proposal to establish a committee to explore electoral reforms. They would not comment or discuss earlier elections but simply offer proposals to ensure more transparency in the future. We could support such a committee and lower tensions, or we could accept an offer by the military to privately bring about cooperation."
 CHP_1954.2.d:0 "A joint committee presented its report on reforming the electoral process for greater transparency to the Grand National Assembly. Its authors note they do not believe any previous elections had issues, but noted its recommendations would ease any concerns by voters and more streamline the voting process. The legislature is expected to pass the recommendations in the coming weeks. Many observers view this as a great success for the government and will go a long way to easing tension with the opposition."
 CHP_1954.3.d:0 "The tension and bickering in the Grand National Assembly noticeably decreased in recent weeks. Opposition leaders have held their tongues and those seen as privately flaming rumors the last election had been rigged are now explicitly stating the elections were fair. It appears the military has done a good job of talking to and calming down the opposition. The government did not ask for details but there are rumors of bribes, coercion, and blackmail being used against the opposition. Hopefully the government will enjoy a more productive legislative agenda."
 CHP_1954.4.d:0 "There is public outcry and an emboldened opposition at the Grand National Assembly. Some low-level members of the opposition revealed they had been approached by military officials to be more supportive of the government. Once they stepped forward, other opposition members stepped up, claiming they had faced threats or offers of cash to be more compliant. The government has denied any involvement and the military claims some of its members may have acted contrary to standing orders. Regardless, this exposure weakens the government, strengthens the opposition, and gives credence to those who accuse the CHP of rigging the last election with the military."
 CHP_1954.5.d:0 "Since 1945 Turkey has seen a dramatic inflow of cash from abroad, either through investments or international aid. The Turkish government at times has infused its own cash to support economic development and infrastructure projects. The Finance Minister believes the economy is unable to absorb and is at risk of drowning. He proposes the government institute fiscal reforms and take measures to curb spending, even at the cost of immediate growth. However, some of our other economic advisors and our political advisors believe such a shift will cause undue hardship to the Turkish people and that the risks are probably being overstated."
 TUR_1950_ELECTIONS.5.d:0 "The Democratic Party has triumphed in the 1954 Elections. Party leader Adnan Menderes is expected to lead government as Prime Minister, leaving the Presidency to Celal Bayar. The Democratic Party promises a free market economy and privatization to spur economic growth. However, it takes over an economy already with high inflation. In addition, the Democratic Party must contend with a military suspicious of its intentions and the threat of traditional political elites resisting the party bringing in commercial, agricultural, and industrial elites to positions of power."
 DP_1954.1.d:0 "The Finance Minister reports the current cash reserves are dangerously low. He cites the continued infusion of cash by the government to spur growth and a decline in foreign capital to sustain the current economic situation. The minister recommends a curb on spending and fiscal measures to bring inflation under control for long-term stability. However, some of the other economic and political advisors warn such an action could cripple the economy and cost us in the next election."
 TUR_1950_ELECTIONS.6.d:0 "WIP
 TUR_1950_ELECTIONS.7.d:0 "The Republican Party (CHP) has defeated the Democratic Party (DP) in the recent general election. The victory confirms the desire for Turks to maintain the leadership and policies that carefully guided the nation in the early years of the republic. The military-bureaucratic elite is said to be greatly satisfied by the result. However, the opposition and liberal circles are said to be disappointed by the results. Many Turks are said to be increasingly frustrated by what they see is a large, ineffective military and bureaucratic elite. The CHP promises to maintain a carefully controlled economy. The left wing of the DP is now gaining more ground it appears a leftwing shift for the party is needed if it can overcome the CHP in the future."
 CHP_1957.1.d:0 "The Finance Minister proposed we ease tariffs slightly. This would represent a shift in government policy which has maintained high tariffs to encourage domestic production. However, the minister suggests the tariffs are actually punishing local industry and stunting potential growth. The ease in tariffs would spur growth for the economy and keep inflation manageable. Other economic and political advisors warn the government not to ease the tariffs as it contradicts the government program. The government must decide to ease the tariffs or maintain them."
 CHP_1957.2.d:0 "There is an alarming turn towards socialism and the left among Democratic Party supporters. They are increasingly disenchanted with the government and its reliance on traditional elites and the military. They also long for the implementation of socialist policies and a widening of the political class. This is a major threat to the Kemalist order and the principles on which the republic was founded. The military and intelligence services would like to implement operations to decapitate the burgeoning socialist movement and detain its leaders. However, such actions may end up only infuriating the socialists. The other option is to let the socialists be and challenge them electorally, which could undercut their belief that the government is autocratic."
 CHP_1957.3.d:0 "The military and intelligence operation to arrest socialist leaders and agitators has been a major success. Socialist activism is declining, especially on the university campuses. The government privately is applauding the actions while publicly declining to speak on the rumors of a crackdown. It appears the decision to strategically target these agitators was a success. Turkey will be protected from the socialist scourge, which is the first step towards communism and the totalitarianism that entails."
 CHP_1957.4.d:0 "The recent operations by the military and intelligence to detain socialist leaders and curb their activism has backfired. It appears university students realized what was happening during one attempted arrest, resulting in a public incident involving students and soldiers. The next day protests broke out and other campuses joined in resulting in an embarrassing situation for the government. Many of the detained were quickly released, without being persuaded to tone down their activities. Reports indicate even more Democratic Party supporters are now turning towards socialism and there is increasing disenchantment with what many are now seeing as a political structure of two centrist parties."
 TUR_1950_ELECTIONS.8.d:0 "The Democratic Party has won the 1957 Elections. Party leader Adnan Menderes is expected to lead the government as Prime Minister, leaving the Presidency to Celal Bayar. The Democratic Party promises a free market economy and privatization to spur economic growth. However, it takes over an economy already with high inflation. In addition, the Democratic Party must contend with a military suspicious of its intentions and the threat of traditional political elites resisting the party bringing in commercial, agricultural, and industrial elites to positions of power. The Democratic Party also recognizes the traditional elite and their control of the media, efforts must be made to crackdown on hostile, domestic propaganda."
 DP_1957.1.d:0 "The opposition and their media allies are now blatantly encouraging unrest and insurrection against the government. The Interior Minister suggests that this effort is designed to spur unrest among Kemalists in order to facilitate a military coup. Some of our ministers believe the time is now to call on the Army to obey the government and help impose order and shutter media outlets violating the law. However, some of the ministers believe the conspiracy sounds farfetched and calling the Army to target groups it sees as allies may actually push the military closer to taking action against the government."
 TUR_FOR.1.d:0 "In the aftermath of the Arab-Israeli War, the Middle East is in a delicate position. We are one of the few countries to have diplomatic contact with the Israelis and it has provided benefits to our government. However, this does not sit well with the more devout Turkish Muslims and there is pressure to expand ties with fellow Muslim states. This despite our efforts to downplay the Israeli contact. The Foreign Ministry believes we can expand the early, promising ties with Israel by establishing a legation while also seeking friendship with the major Arab powers. The other option could be to end the nascent Israeli ties and pivot completely to the Arabs."
 TUR_FOR.2.d:0 "The government of Turkey recently reached out and requested the normalization of ties and cultural exchanges. They wish to apparently rekindle the old brotherly bonds established during the centuries of Ottoman rule. However, they maintain relations with the Israelis and reports indicate this relationship is only being expanded. Many of our officials believe we should rebuff the Turkish request in solidarity and let it be known that aiding the enemy of the Arabs will not be appreciated. Other officials believe we should open ties in order to limit Israeli influence and eventually persuade them."
 TUR_FOR.3.d:0 "The Egyptian government rebuffed our request at expanded bilateral ties and encourage cultural exchanges. The Egyptians were clear that this is due to our ties with the Israelis. This is a diplomatic setback and hinders our efforts to convince the Turkish people that we can maintain positive relations with Muslim states while also having ties with Israel. The Egyptian media openly condemning our Israeli contacts is also unfortunate as it exposes our downplaying of such relations to the Turkish public."
 TUR_FOR.4.d:0 "The Saudi government rebuffed our request at expanded bilateral ties and encourage cultural exchanges. The Saudis were clear that this is due to our ties with the Israelis. This is a diplomatic setback and hinders our efforts to convince the Turkish people that we can maintain positive relations with Muslim states while also having ties with Israel. The Saudi media openly condemning our Israeli contacts is also unfortunate as it exposes our downplaying of such relations to the Turkish public."
 TUR_FOR.5.d:0 "The Iraqi government rebuffed our request at expanded bilateral ties and encourage cultural exchanges. The Iraqis were clear that this is due to our ties with the Israelis. This is a diplomatic setback and hinders our efforts to convince the Turkish people that we can maintain positive relations with Muslim states while also having ties with Israel. The Iraqi media openly condemning our Israeli contacts is also unfortunate as it exposes our downplaying of such relations to the Turkish public."
 TUR_FOR.6.d:0 "The Syrian government rebuffed our request at expanded bilateral ties and encourage cultural exchanges. The Syrians were clear that this is due to our ties with the Israelis. This is a diplomatic setback and hinders our efforts to convince the Turkish people that we can maintain positive relations with Muslim states while also having ties with Israel. The Syrian media openly condemning our Israeli contacts is also unfortunate as it exposes our downplaying of such relations to the Turkish public."
 TUR_FOR.7.d:0 "The Egyptian government accepted our request at expanding bilateral ties and cultural exchanges. The Egyptians agreed with us on the importance of maintaining the historical contact between our peoples. The Egyptians did add their disapproval of our ties with Israel but as long as we continue to downplay it, they will not bring it up. The Turkish people will be satisfied with this news. The Foreign Ministry is masterfully balancing our ties in the region."
 TUR_FOR.8.d:0 "The Saudi government accepted our request at expanding bilateral ties and cultural exchanges. The Saudis agreed with us on the importance of maintaining the historical contact between our peoples. The Saudis did add their disapproval of our ties with Israel but as long as we continue to downplay it, they will not bring it up. The Turkish people will be satisfied with this news. The Foreign Ministry is masterfully balancing our ties in the region."
 TUR_FOR.9.d:0 "The Iraqi government accepted our request at expanding bilateral ties and cultural exchanges. The Iraqis agreed with us on the importance of maintaining the historical contact between our peoples. The Iraqis did add their disapproval of our ties with Israel but as long as we continue to downplay it, they will not bring it up. The Turkish people will be satisfied with this news. The Foreign Ministry is masterfully balancing our ties in the region."
 TUR_FOR.10.d:0 "The Syrian government accepted our request at expanding bilateral ties and cultural exchanges. The Syrians agreed with us on the importance of maintaining the historical contact between our peoples. The Syrians did add their disapproval of our ties with Israel but as long as we continue to downplay it, they will not bring it up. The Turkish people will be satisfied with this news. The Foreign Ministry is masterfully balancing our ties in the region."
 TUR_FOR.11.d:0 "The Israeli government recently invited us to join a Peripheral Pact. This would be a deeper, strategic relationship between our governments. They claimed such a relationship would be kept covert as to not antagonize our Muslim population and promise economic and military cooperation. The Israelis are seeking to expand ties with non-Arab Muslim states in the region to be a counterbalance to their Arab opponents. Such a covert relationship could offer much benefits, but its discovery would provoke public backlash."
 TUR_FOR.12.d:0 "The Turkish government has agreed to join the Peripheral Pact. This is a major foreign policy victory as Turkey is probably the most powerful non-Arab Muslim state in the region. The Turks are looking forward to deeper economic and military cooperation. With Turkish support, even if covert, we are much less isolated than before and overtime could potentially develop the relationship to the point of having a strong northern threat to the Arab states allied against us."
 TUR_FOR.13.d:0 "The Turkish government declined the proposal to join the Peripheral Pact. Although covert, the Turks apparently are not comfortable with the consequences if the relationship were publicly revealed. Although it is clear Turkey is not seeking to sever ties, this is a major blow to our plans. The Peripheral Pact seeks to counter the Arab coalition by allying us with the non-Arab Muslim states in the region. This will break their attempts at isolating us internationally."
 TUR_FOR.14.d:0 "As part of a new regional policy, Turkey announced it would rescind its recognition of Israel. The planned establishment of a permanent diplomatic mission to the country will be cancelled and any Turkish citizens in Israel are to return home immediately. The Israeli government is said to be quite shocked by the reversal, with some Israeli politicians blaming the influence of anti-Semites in Ankara. Across the wider Arab World, the news is being widely praised. Newspapers are lauding Turkey for once again standing with the Arabs. Some editorials in Turkey claim the decision marks a return of brotherly ties between Turks and Arabs."
 TUR_FOR.15.d:0 "We have a long, troubled history with the Greeks, stretching centuries. In recent decades, this conflict almost led to the death of our nation. They picked at the dying carcass of the Ottoman Empire and then sought to strangle our republic in the cradle. We persevered and overcame these challenges. Despite a lull in direct hostilities, tensions remain, and considering the challenges we face on our east and the chaos of the Middle East, tensions with Greece could lead to a future catastrophe. There are some who wish to engage the Greek government and propose a series of confidence building measures to reduce tensions. Doing so would shore up our resources to better manage the myriad of security issues facing our nation."
 TUR_FOR.16.d:0 "The Turkish government wishes to engage with high level talks. They acknowledge we both have our differences on a number of issues but wish to conclude a series of confidence building measures. This would include facilitating opportunities for trade, cultural exchanges, student programs, and military to military talks. It is an intriguing proposal, the situation to our north remains uncertain, especially in the aftermath of the last war. Normalizing Turkish relations could provide a relief. However, there are those who oppose holding talks, they believe it is a ploy for Turkey to continue holding Greek territory hostage while reaping the benefits of bilateral relations."
 TUR_FOR.17.d:0 "A series of agreements were signed in Athens between Greece and Turkey. The high-level Turkish delegation had arrived several days earlier and expressed great satisfaction with the results. The two sides have pledged to boost relations, trade, and contact. There will be a series of cultural exchanges, economic missions, military to military talks, and expanded trade opportunities. Although some in both nations will be disappointed that neither side appeared willing to press on any of the historical or territorial grievances, most are expected to support this effort to reduce tensions."
 TUR_CYPRUS.1.d:0 "The situation in Cyprus continues to deteriorate. Greek extremists are openly targeting the British and assaulting innocent Turks on the island. The Turkish people are following the situation with increasing concern as it is clear the Greeks plan on seizing the island and push for unification with Greece. Such a scenario would result in a new round of ethnic cleansing on the island which is unacceptable. Turkey must engage with Turks on the island and determine how to help."
 TUR_CYPRUS.2.d:0 "The Treaty of Guarantee was recently signed between Turkey, the United Kingdom, Greece, and Cyprus. The treaty establishes an independent, democratic Cyprus state. It must maintain its constitution and balance power between the Greek and Turkish population on the island. If any party breaks from the agreement, any of the signatories can unilaterally intervene only to restore the treaty. We are allowed to maintain a small garrison on the island to protect the Turkish population. We must decide how proactive the garrison will be. We can maintain a passive stance, basically only positioned to intervene if the Turkish population is at risk of being attacked. Or we can be proactive and closely gather intelligence and be able to intervene if the constitution is changed."
 TUR_CYPRUS.3.d:0 "The Greek Cypriotes greatly escalated the crisis by seizing control of the island and proclaiming enosis (unification) with Greece. The Turkish Cypriotes are in a panic and are demanding a rapid Turkish intervention. Across Turkey the media and crowds are calling for the government to act. The military has a plan to rapidly deploy a force to secure the Turkish part of the island and shield them from the risk of ethnic cleansing. Such an action will likely provoke a response from Greece that may lead to war. The United States may also view the situation unfavorably. However, to not intervene would risk the destruction of the Turkish Cypriote population and the wrath of the people."
 TUR_ARAB.1.d:0 "The formation of the United Arab Republic (UAR) brings the threat of Arab nationalism to our border. Hatay has long been a desire for Syria and Arabs in the region who see it as the last Turkish occupied Arab land. The General Staff has developed a plan to proactively counter this threat. We can listen to their proposal and decide to take action. However, many in the government believe the UAR is much more focused on the Israel conflict and the only way Hatay will become an issue is if we escalate the situation."
 TUR_ARAB.2.d:0 "The Turkish military presented a proposal to the government regarding the United Arab Republic (UAR). The military states it has information that the non-Arab population in northern Syria is concerned with the rise of Arab nationalism. It would not be difficult to orchestrate a border clash that escalates into a conflict. The military believes it can swiftly seize territory and establish a buffer zone in northern Syria. This is a risky operation, but it may ensure the protection of Hatay. However, some of the top officials are more cautious and believe the best way to counter a potential Arab nationalist threat is to normalize ties with the UAR."
 TUR_ARAB.3.d:0 "In a major agreement, Turkey and the United Arab Republic (UAR) agreed to normalize ties and institute cultural exchanges. Both governments emphasized any rumors of mistrust or tension is overblown. The development is being welcomed across the region and gives greater legitimacy to the UAR. Worries among Turkish officials that the UAR would press for Hatay appear to have subsided."
 TUR_ARAB.4.d:0 "The Turkish military defeated United Arab Republic (UAR) along their northern border. The Turkish military is largely in control of northern Syria. The conflict began after a border conflict escalated into a full-scale border war. The UAR appeared unprepared and could not fight off the Turkish incursion. Although Turkey maintains it reacted to UAR aggression, the UAR claims Turkey launched an unprovoked invasion. The UAR forces are said to be scrambling to reorganize as it fears further attacks as Turkey appears in control."
 TUR_ARAB.5.d:0 "The United Arab Republic (UAR) declared victory in the border conflict with Turkey. The fighting broke out after a border clash escalated into a wider border war. The UAR insists its forces were attacked first and they responded diligently. The Turkish government claims its forces were the victims. Concerns that the UAR may seek to counterattack and cease Hatay did not occur. The United States had openly warned the UAR of such an action. This is a major setback for the Turkish military."
 TUR_ARAB.6.d:0 "Our military successfully established a buffer zone in northern Syria. Commanders are confident and elated with their success. The General Staff is now proposing a full-scale assault on the UAR. If we can cease Damascus, we can break up the Arab nationalist state and establish a friendly regime in Syria. This would guarantee the protection of Hatay. However, escalating the conflict could risk unforeseen consequences and many officials believe we should be satisfied with the buffer zone."
 TUR_ARAB.7.d:0 "With the United Arab Republic no longer a threat, there is increasing pressure, especially in the region, for our forces to withdraw from northern Syria. This would be welcome support to the new regime and we can secure a non-aggression pact to guarantee the protection of Hatay. The military however believes we should maintain control of northern Syria and begin integrating the territory. They point out if the Syrians return, they may seek revenge on non-Arab groups that welcomed our forces. However, continued occupation would likely lead to Arab unrest and even armed resistance to our forces."
 TUR_ARAB.8.d:0 "The Turkish government announced its forces were pushing into Syria to liberate it from Egyptian occupation. The United Arab Republic (UAR) has condemned this invasion, claiming the Arab people will throw back this Ottoman aggression. In Damascus there are calls for people to join the war effort and defend this attempt to destroy a united Arab state. The Turkish action is being condemned across the Arab world."
 TUR_ARAB.9.d:0 "After a month of fighting, a United Nations ceasefire has been declared to end the fighting between Turkey and the United Arab Republic (UAR). Both sides are declaring victory but once the dust settles it will be clear what occurred. The United Nations worked tirelessly once the conflict started to bring it to a swift end. The Turkish government started the war in order to re-establish a Syrian regime and break the UAR."
 TUR_ARAB.10.d:0 "A new Syrian regime has been declared in Damascus. The new government thanked Turkey for liberating its people from Egyptian colonialism and promised to restore Syrian sovereignty. Turkish forces are beginning a rapid withdrawal from the territories, though it remains in control of northern Syria. Remaining Egyptian officials and military personnel are being repatriated back to Cairo and all previous treaties related to the United Arab Republic (UAR) have been cancelled. This confirms the Turkish victory and marks an end to the pan-Arab UAR."
 TUR_ARAB.11.d:0 "The fighting between Turkey and the United Arab Republic (UAR) has ended in a stalemate. Neither side appeared able to achieve a major breakthrough to achieve a decisive victory. However, as Turkey initiated the conflict, they will view it as a defeat. The Turkish government insists it achieved its basic objectives. However, the UAR is declaring victory, claiming its forces successfully defeated foreign aggression and has preserved Arab lands. Captured Turkish weapons and equipment are being paraded around Damascus."
 TUR_ARAB.12.d:0 "The recent conflict between Turkey and the United Arab Republic (UAR) ended in a victory for the UAR. Turkey had sought to invade Syria and breakup the UAR. However, its offensive was not only beaten back but the UAR managed to capture the disputed territory of Hatay. The UAR held a major parade in Hatay, claiming it is the final liberation of Arab lands from the Turks. The Turkish government and military must do some soul-searching and be thankful the losses were not more."
 TUR_Kurdish.1.d:0 "Even before the founding of the republic, the Kurdish Question has plagued the Turkish government. In the early years of the republic efforts to integrate the Kurds was met with rebellion and resistance. Efforts to spread education and development have also been challenged. One group of officials believe we must redouble our efforts to civilize and integrate these Kurds, who are really Mountain Turks. However, another group of officials argue we must engage the Kurds on their terms and open negotiations with their leaders and seek a more cooperative, inclusive approach. We must decide what track to take."
 TUR_Kurdish.2.d:0 "We have successfully instituted a process of Turkifying the mountain peoples. Through economic investments, education scholarships, and incentives we are encouraging many to travel from their isolated villages to cities. In the cities they are finally engaging with their fellow Turks and are being exposed to modern ideas and republican values. The backwards influence of their elders is weakening and in time there will be no differences among all the people of Turkey."
 TUR_Kurdish.3.d:0 "instances of banditry in the mountains has steeply declined. The Kurdish leaders are much more comfortable and open with government officials and police. Bandits once seen as champions for the downtrodden are now rightly recognized for the criminals they are. Kurdish families are expressing satisfaction with government tolerance of Kurdish language lessons and cultural practices, even in Turkish cities. This has established a relationship of mutual respect between us and the Kurds.
