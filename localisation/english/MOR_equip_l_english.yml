 MOR_infantry_equipment_0_desc:0 "The MAS-36 is a bolt action rifle designed in 1927 chambered in 7.62x54mm French cartridge, and was adopted by the French military in 1936 as a replacement for the Berthier and Lebel service rifles. It saw service during the Second World War in limited numbers, but due to mass production after the war ended it would see service in numerous conflicts by many different nations. Post WWII produced rifles saw some upgrades in terms of ergonomics. It even saw some variants that saw the addition of an attachable rifle grenade and a marksman model. She was expected to only be an interim rifle, built on machinery that could be used to build anticipated self-loading rifles"

The engine is an optimized variant of the V12 used in prior Patton tanks with a light fuel injection system and is supercharged. It has an operation range off-road of 160 miles and 300 miles on-road. It can drive on road at 30 mph but clocks in at 20 mph off road due to the improved engine, transmission, and tracks. It served as the primary tank in the Vietnam war and was commonly used by the US's Cold War allies. It resembles the M47 Patton but is a completely new design with new internal mechanisms. It is used by the US army and Marines before eventually being replaced with the M60 although many national guard units still operated and maintained M48s until the late 80s."

It has approximately 220mm of armor and carries a 105mm main gun. It typically used the M73 7.62x51mm machine gun as its secondary armament. The engine is an improved V12 twin-turbo engine that can move about the same speed as the M48. However, despite weighing slightly more than the M48, the M60 can move about the same speed and across the same difference. The M60 underwent many different minor changes throughout its life and has approximately 4 variants as a result of this. This meant increases in the armor, the weight and improvements to reliability."

It costed almost half as much as the T-64 and came with vast improvements. Its design was finished in 1973 by Leonid Venediktov and showed incredible capability. The gun and armor were still 125mm and composite respectively but with a vastly more economically feasible design that was easier to produce. The engine is a V-12 780 hp that could be later refitted with the a 1130 hp design. The tank could achieve incredible mobility achieving speeds of 80 km/h and could match harsher terrains better than the T-64. It saw usage in all soviet-sphere conflicts, unlike the T-64, and displayed incredible capability in them as well. The tank has also seen plenty of usage in out-of-sphere African, Middle Eastern, and Indochinese conflicts."
