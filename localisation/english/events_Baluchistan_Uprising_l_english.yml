 Baluchistan_Uprising.100.d:0 "The major tribal sardars in Baluchistan have sent a list of demands to the government. They are essentially demanding autonomy, control over development, and profits from resource extraction. Our top federal and military officials in the province note the tribal sardars maintain a stranglehold on the people and impose archaic tribal laws. They also note Baluchistan has a relatively smaller population and is rich with national resources, they strongly recommend we reject demands. Some of the political advisors caution that refusing the demands may cause an uprising, though it will result in us losing access to resources in Baluchistan."
 Baluchistan_Uprising.101.d:0 "General Rahimuddin Khan has been appointed governor of Baluchistan. His temperament and experience makes him ideal for the task. At the moment, we certainly have the military firepower to suppress the rebels, but without effective governance, any military gains will disappear quickly. The provincial government is unreliable and helped cause the crisis in the first place. An effective military government must be established to restore order in the province. The new governor will oversee a restoration of governance, engage with Baluch political leaders, and oversee an end to the conflict. With military support, we expect the political situation to rapidly stabilize."
 Baluchistan_Uprising.0.d:0 "Following the rejection of their demands, many Baluch sardars have fled to the mountains with their loyalists. In recent days they have begun armed attacks targeting police and paramilitary outposts, these raids appear to be focused on capturing arms and intercepting major transport routes. Our officials in key villages have been forced to flee after facing threats. The military has dismissed these actions, noting many of the Baluch miscreants are armed with vintage rifles and do not have the numbers or training to pose a serious threat to Pakitan."
 Baluchistan_Uprising.1.d:0 "Despite the confidence expressed by the GHQ in Rawalpindi, it appears the Baluch tribal fighters’ ranks have swelled in recent weeks. In addition, their attacks have grown both in numbers and sophistication. Of particular concern, are defections of ethnic Baluch police and paramilitary troops. Many of the paramilitary officers have expressed concern over the combat effectiveness and reliability of their forces. From Quetta, the authorities express concern that although the rebels appear to be operating in the mountains, if action is not done soon, they may soon try to seize villages and towns. The Pakistan Army announced a plan to deploy troops immediately to the province and end the rebellion. The military promises a swift resolution, but their assessments have been overly optimistic in the past."
 Baluchistan_Uprising.2.d:0 "The Pakistani government recently dispatched a high-level diplomatic and military mission to visit our leadership. They presented a report on the ongoing unrest in Baluchistan and shared intelligence indicating the Baluch rebels are establishing connections with Iranian Baluch leaders. It is clear if the rebels succeed, they may end up stirring our own Baluch population or seek to expand their control into our own territory. We must decide what level of support to provide Pakistan, we can offer economic support, especially with oil and military subsidies. Some of our top military leaders believe it is in our interest to provide both military and economic support. Regardless, we must offer some help to the Pakistanis in this difficult period."
 Baluchistan_Uprising.3.d:0 "The Pakistanis recently announced a series of restriction on movement into Baluchistan from Afghanistan. This will hurt our economy but more importantly, separate families that live alongside the border. The Pakistanis are clearly seeking to punish the Baluch people for their just demands. It only redoubles our own efforts to champion the cause of the Pashtoon and Baluch people living under the boot of the Pakistan Army. We will strongly condemn this action and maintain vigilance to potential aggression. We will also allow the Baluch to broadcast their message from our radio towers."
 Baluchistan_Uprising.4.d:0 "The Pakistan government announced its navy will be patrolling and blockading Baluchistan from the smuggling of arms and supplies to rebels. The Pakistanis claim it is foreign powers who are making the situation worse and openly blaming us. Clearly this is propaganda meant to cover the oppressive policies and brutal tactics of the military. Our own intelligence will continue to offer support to the Baluch people, though this will now be restricted. These actions indicate a desperation by the Pakistanis and show they are losing control."
 Baluchistan_Uprising.5.d:0 "A loyal Baluch tribal leader informed the government that the Iraqi government recently facilitated a shipment of arms intended for Baluch rebels. He insisted the weapons are being kept at the Iraqi Embassy in Islamabad. Using this intelligence, the Pakistan Rangers, supported by the local police raided the embassy. During the operation our forces uncovered hundreds of Soviet submachine guns, fifty-thousand rounds of ammunition, and cash intended for the rebels. We have expelled the Iraqi ambassador. Confirming their guilt, Baghdad then hosted a senior rebel tribal leader. We believe the Iraqis are backing the rebels out of support for their friend India and to threaten Iranian Baluchistan. Regardless, this is a major victory for our forces and exposes Iraqi treachery."
 Baluchistan_Uprising.8.d:0 "The commanders in Baluchistan are requesting permission to use heavy weapons, which include field artillery and tanks in order to flush out Baluchi rebels. Many of the officers in the field note rebel forces are able to melt away into the mountains and remote villages after attacks. With artillery and tank fire our troops could retaliate and limit their safe havens from which to operate against us. The military appears very keen on deploying such weapons. However, some national security advisors point out such firepower may result in more civilian casualties as these weapons engulf large areas and are not always accurate. The military has accepted these concerns and promised civilian casualties would be kept at a minimum, however, they firmly stated their belief that protecting the lives of Pakistani soldiers and restoring law and order swiftly is worth the risks."
 Baluchistan_Uprising.9.d:0 "The deployment of heavy weapons in Baluchistan has proven to be very effective. From the beginning, the successful deployment of Pakistani artillery along with spotters and Air Force surveillance allowed the Army to break up large rebel concentrations with accurate artillery fire. The Baluch rebels are adapting by operating in smaller groups and launching attacks from cover, but even in those situations when our armour is present, we have been flushing them out. The miscreants can no longer claim the mountains exclusively as their own. The main difference has been the Baluch fighters switching to smaller numbers, this has reduced their ability to launch spectacular attacks and improves the ability of our outposts to better resist rebel raids."
 Baluchistan_Uprising.10.d:0 "The deployment of heavy weapons, especially artillery and tanks has completely backfired. Although the Army has used the weapons to breakup large rebel concentrations, there have been notable incidents of failed targeting and aggressive assaults that resulted unintentionally led to civilian casualties. This has only provoked more tribes to leave the government and support the rebels. In one case a loyal Baluchi elder informed us that though he remained loyal, most of the young men of his tribe had slipped into the mountains. In appears our spotters occasionally mistake a concentration of tribesmen engaged in a meeting or wedding as rebel concentrations. In addition, there were a few incidents where our forces came under fire from a nearby village and the local commander ordered the village assaulted, using artillery and tanks, which ended up causing extensive damage and led to complaints from local tribal leaders."
 Baluchistan_Uprising.11.d:0 "In recent operations in Baluchistan, the military and security forces have apprehended a number of suspected rebel fighters. These men are often interrogated and held in detention, however, there legal status is not clarified. Recently, a colonel at GHQ wrote a recommendation for the military to hand over suspected fighters to local and federal courts to try them. Many of these suspects can be tried under colonial sedition laws and it would give legitimacy to our operations and conduct with prisoners. The report was brought to the cabinet level where a decision must be made. Opponents to the measure fear local courts may have rebel sympathizers and giving the rebels a platform to express their propaganda could end up hurting our efforts. We must consider if the potential benefits outweigh the potential issues with using the courts."
 Baluchistan_Uprising.12.d:0 "The recent decision by the government to bring suspected Baluch rebels to trial has shown the country the true extent of the rebel threat. Prosecutors are able to explain the amount of violence perpetrated by the accused and have painted a narrative of a bloodthirsty rebel army bent on destroying the Pakistani nation. Of special interest to many Pakistanis reading or listening to news about the trial, are claims of foreign involvement with the Baluch rebels. The government often proves the origins of weapons captured with the rebels and inferring the rebels are receiving foreign support, especially from India. Although human rights groups continue to criticize the military actions, the government notes the trials prove the state remains devoted to law and order."
 Baluchistan_Uprising.13.d:0 "The recent decision by the government to bring suspected Baluch rebels to trial has failed to show the country the true extent of the rebel threat. Although prosecutors have worked hard to emphasize the violence of the accused and their connection to foreign powers, many in the public have been captivated by the testimony of accused rebels. These, often humble Baluch tribesmen, paint an image of a society perpetually ignored by the state and the target of overwhelming military repression.  Many are saying the Baluch has only asked for dignity since 1947 but have been denied and if the government continues to deny them, they will lose the people of Baluchistan. On university campuses, there is increased agitation and criticism towards the military for its heavy-handed approach. Some university students are rumored to have fled to the mountains and join the rebels in response."
 Baluchistan_Uprising.14.d:0 "With the Pakistan government agreeing to withdraw from Baluchistan, there has been a large exodus of non-Baluch and government families out of the province. The Pakistan military convoys are often clogged with the new refugees, especially from the large Pathan community in Quetta. The refugees are heading towards Peshawar and Karachi. The Pakistan government warned any attempts to hinder the movement of refugees to Pakistan will not be tolerated and so far, it appears the victorious Baluch fighters are not interested in targeting the refugees or retreated military forces. As per the recent agreement, once the Pakistani forces leave the province, all political and military Baluch prisoners will be returned to Baluchistan. There is a sense of bitterness and humiliation among the people of Pakistan."
 Baluchistan_Uprising.15.d:0 "The Pakistani Army presented a report to top government leaders. The Army noted that Quetta was largely a Pathan city, with a powerful defence infrastructure, including the Staff College. They noted that despite the exodus of many refugees, the city remains so and many of the Pathans refugees from Quetta are petitioning the military to return them home. The Army requests the government present Baluchistan with an ultimatum. They must return Quetta and the lands around it with Pathan populations back to Pakistan or the Army will take it by force. The Pakistan military guarantees it will have no issue securing this part of Baluchistan as it is historically loyal to Pakistan and Baluch rebels cannot imbed themselves. They want the government to use a recent clash between Baluch and Pathan tribesmen as an excuse for the ultimatum."
 Baluchistan_Uprising.16.d:0 "The Pakistan government, citing a recent clash between Baluch and Pathan fighters as an excuse, that we withdraw from Quetta and the Pathan majority lands. Essentially Pakistan wishes to secure Quetta and a land corridor to the North-West Frontier Province. We are a new, young state and though we did fight off the Pakistani occupation, trying to hold on to this area would require a conventional military defence which our commanders are not confident in. Those who want us to accept the ultimatum note we can portray it as self-determination and gain international legitimacy and praise. Others however, believe losing Quetta and its infrastructure and economic potential could cripple our new state and even if we lose, we should fight till we are forced out and show the world our determination. The choice is ours."
 Baluchistan_Uprising.17.d:0 "Baluchistan refused our just demand for Quetta and the restoration of our refugees to their homes. As expected, the Baluch fighters were no match to our military forces and Quetta was seized easily. Newspapers across Pakistan published pictures of our forces marching in the city and our raising of the flag over Zhob Fort. The victory is a small consolation after the humiliating defeat suffered at the hands of the Baluch guerrilla fighters. In Peshawar and Karachi, "victory" caravans of refugees are planning to set out and return home. To showcase the confidence of our military victory, the Army announced it would open the Quetta Staff College in only a few months."
 Baluchistan_Uprising.18.d:0 "Our forces fought valiantly and tenaciously, however, they could not stem the advance of the Pakistani forces. The Pakistanis brought overwhelming force, including heavy weaponry, using everything to seize Quetta from us. Our own forces, even in these difficult circumstances, still sought to minimize the use of heavy munitions and protect both property and civilian lives. Although the Pakistani government is portraying its actions as just and its victory as total, Baluchistan remains independent. More importantly, the world sees the naked aggression of Pakistan. Given these circumstances, we must seek protection and find friends for the future."
 Baluchistan_Uprising.19.d:0 "The Baluchistan government has formally requested we guarantee their sovereignty following their recent border conflict with Pakistan. Despite achieving independence, the Pakistanis managed to undermine their sovereignty by taking valuable territory it could occupy with overwhelming force. Baluchistan recognizes it is only a matter of time before the Pakistanis seek another effort to cut it down and that is why they have asked us for help. They believe if we guarantee their territorial integrity, both Pakistan and Iran will be hesitant to strangle Baluchistan in the cradle. We could certainly agree and keep Pakistan in a perpetual two front threat, but some argue Baluchistan, without Quetta, can never be strong and we could be dragged into a hopeless conflict in the future."
 Baluchistan_Uprising.20.d:0 "Many of the pictures from the recent border conflict show our soldiers with sly grins on their faces. Despite what many felt would be impossible odds, our brave soldiers managed to blunt the Pakistani invasion. The Pakistanis had sought to invent a means to seize Quetta from us but have been thwarted. The international community will look at us closely as our once guerrilla fighters proved to be adept conventional soldiers as well. Our forces took a number of Pakistani prisoners, including officers and plan on showcasing the destroyed and abandoned equipment left by the retreat Pakistani forces. This battle marks a major victory, but we must remain vigilant and consider finding more foreign allies."
 Baluchistan_Uprising.21.d:0 "The government had to issue a media blackout once it became apparent our offensive failed. We promised a swift victory but instead our forces faced a much more tenacious foe than expected. Reports from the front suggest our intelligence underestimated not just the size and training of the Baluchistan forces but also their tactical capabilities. The media blackout will only buy us a few days to organize the deployment of more police and paramilitary forces in major cities as we expect unrest once the people become aware of this latest failure. Already our embassies abroad note the international press is reporting on our failures."
 Baluchistan_Uprising.22.d:0 "The Baluchistan Liberation Front organized a large force of tribal fighters to assault Pakistan Army positions around Gwadar. Isolated Army posts are being overrun or surrounded by the rebels as they seek to expand their presence. The Pakistan military will seek to halt the rebel advance as losing Gwadar will give rebels access to foreign support via the sea. Although the rebels are lightly armed, they are highly motivated and believe the Pakistan Army will not react quickly enough to prevent their success. The government continues to downplay news from Baluchistan to prevent panic among the people."
 Baluchistan_Uprising.23.d:0 "The Pakistan garrison in Gwadar rapidly withdrew in the face of advancing Baluchistan Liberation Front fighters and tribal allies. The rebel fighters managed to successfully breakthrough and cut off the garrison. With Pakistan forces unable to operate in the area, it was forced to withdraw. The rebels are parading captured weapons from retreating troops. The Pakistan Army has downplayed the setback, claiming the government remains in control but had to redeploy its assets in the area. It pledged to deal with the reactionary Baloch tribal chiefs who are misleading the people."
 Baluchistan_Uprising.24.d:0 "The Pakistan garrison in Gwadar welcomed a contingent of foreign media flown in from Islamabad. The Army paraded captured small arms, explosives, and rebels. The Baluchistan Liberation Front and its tribal allies recently launched an assault to wrestle Gwadar from the Pakistan government. However, the Pakistan Army managed to thwart the attack, inflicting heavy casualties on the assailants. The rebel leaders in Kabul condemned the Pakistan government for indiscriminate violence against the Baloch people. In Islamabad, the government insists it remains in control and the tribal chiefs must pledge obedience to the nation."
 Baluchistan_Uprising.25.d:0 "The Pakistan Army confirmed its forces were advancing on Gwadar. The Army claims the rebels are using the port to illegally acquire arms from hostile powers, in a veiled accusation to India. The initial Baluchistan Liberation Front offensive which captured the sleepy port city was an initial major victory for the separatist movement. Many experts suggest the only way for the Army to succeed will be to bring enough overwhelming military force against the tenacious tribal fighters. The rebels will rely on their fighting spirit and knowledge of the terrain to fight off the attack."
 Baluchistan_Uprising.26.d:0 "The Pakistan Army held a large flag raising ceremony in Gwadar, confirming their victory over the Baloch separatists who occupied the port. Although the Pakistan government refuses to divulge casualty figures, it has clearly succeeded in defeating the rebel presence. Rebel leaders in Kabul confirmed the setback, stating the Pakistan Army continues to use indiscriminate violence against the Baloch people to achieve its objective. Many senior military and civilian leaders in Pakistan believe the blueprint of this operation will be key to eventually defeating the rebels."
 Baluchistan_Uprising.27.d:0 "Despite a media blackout, it is clear the Pakistan offensive to wrestle Gwadar from Baloch separatists has failed. The foreign press in Islamabad note a sense of despair and even panic among senior officials. Baloch leaders in Kabul congratulated its fighters and people for bravely resisting a brutal assault by an indiscriminate foe. As per policy, news of the setback is being suppressed across Pakistan in order to prevent unrest among the people. However, a number of experts fear the government may have to face its critic if it continues to struggle against the rebels."
 Baluchistan_Uprising.28.d:0 "The Baluchistan Liberation Front and its tribal allies have launched an offensive for Khuzdar and its surrounding areas. The highly motivated fighters are said to have overrun isolated Army posts bordering rebel-controlled territory. The Pakistan Army is said to be organizing a strong response to halt the rebel attack. Despite recent setbacks, the government maintains a media blackout, although it is becoming increasingly difficult to hide the true situation. Baloch exile leaders in Kabul are promising a swift victory for the Baloch people to continue the struggle of defending the right of self-determination for Baluchistan."
 Baluchistan_Uprising.29.d:0 "Against all odds, the Baluchistan Liberation Front and its tribal allies have successfully captured Khuzdar and its surrounding areas from the Pakistan government. The last Pakistan garrisons in the area have withdrawn. They can no longer secure supply lines to the garrisons. The Pakistan effort at maintaining a media blackout appears to be disintegrating. News is spreading across urban areas about the military setbacks, causing some unrest on university campuses. Many students are calling for the government to make peace and provide provincial autonomy for all provinces."
 Baluchistan_Uprising.30.d:0 "In a rare acknowledgement to the ongoing conflict in Baluchistan, the Pakistan Army carefully flew in foreign journalists to Khuzdar. The journalists were shown captured Baloch separatists and piles of captured weapons. Training documents, explosives, and captured mortars were also shown to demonstrate the sophistication of the rebel forces. The Baluchistan Liberation Front and their tribal allies recently launched a major offensive in Khuzdar. The Pakistan government stated the military victory confirms the lack of support for the rebels among the Baloch people and a swift resolution to the conflict will be achieved soon."
 Baluchistan_Uprising.31.d:0 "In a rare acknowledgement of the deteriorating situation in Baluchistan, the Pakistan government announced the army was sending troops to free Khuzdar from the Baluchistan Liberation Front. The BLF leaders in Kabul confirmed their forces were facing an assault by the Pakistan Army. They called on all Baloch to stand firm against an unprovoked barrage by an oppressive central government. The Pakistan government has recently been losing ground to the rebels, and many experts believe they are desperate for a successful offensive. Efforts to enforce a media blackout regarding the conflict has largely fallen apart as most of the province is now under BLF control."
 Baluchistan_Uprising.32.d:0 "The Pakistan government released a photograph of a colonial era fort with the Pakistan flag raised. Showing this as evidence that the recent offensive to retake Khuzdar and its surrounding areas had succeeded. A spokesperson for the Army praised the commanding officers and devotion of the soldiers as being critical for the successful operation. The government promised all of Baluchistan will be pacified in the coming months. The Baluchistan Liberation Front leaders, speaking from exile in Kabul, confirmed the setback and vowed to avenge all the innocent Baluch killed by military action."
 Baluchistan_Uprising.33.d:0 "The Baluchistan Liberation Front has successfully halted and driven back a major offensive by the Pakistan Army in Khuzdar. The BLF leadership in Kabul confirmed the news, praising the resolve of the Baluch people to stand against violent suppression. The Pakistan Army remains tightlipped, refusing to comment on the situation. However, leaks to the media and the general panic of senior military leaders in Islamabad suggest the Khuzdar offensive has ended in failure. The Pakistan government had sought a media blackout on the Baluchistan crisis, however, the recent rebel successes made this impossible. It is now policy not to comment on setbacks and praise all successful operations."
 Baluchistan_Uprising.34.d:0 "The Baluchistan conflict looks to be reaching a critical juncture as the Baluchistan Liberation Army confirmed its fighters were launching a "final liberation" operation to take the capital of Quetta from the Pakistan government. The BLA hopes the confidence its forces gained in recent operations and their morale will be enough to overcome any Pakistan Army defences. The Pakistan Army has vowed to halt any attack by "miscreants" and bring peace to the province. Observers in Quetta note the military has setup checkpoints, fortifications, and are deploying the garrison troops to defend the city. The famed Army and Staff College has temporarily relocated its staff and students until the situation is resolved."
 Baluchistan_Uprising.35.d:0 "The Pakistan Army launched fireworks and lifted recent curfew orders in Quetta. This comes after it halted a major offensive by the Baluchistan Liberation Front. The BLF recently tried to seize the capital of Baluchistan from Pakistan and essentially control the entire province. However, its forces apparently lacked the weapons or capacity to overwhelm Quetta, a major military garrison. BLF leaders in Kabul downplayed the news, stating its forces were temporarily pushed back, but would return soon. Many analysts believe the Pakistan government may seek to take advantage of its victory and try to retake territory lost in earlier rebel offensives. Time will tell if this setback marks a turning point in the conflict."
 Baluchistan_Uprising.36.d:0 "Vehicles loaded with families and their property are clogging the roads out of Quetta. The wives, children and family of serving military personnel or civilian staff with the military are fleeing Quetta as Baluchistan Liberation Front forces begin entering the city. BLF fighters are driving around the city, being met with cheers and sweets by their supporters. Quetta, a bastion for the military since the colonial period has been abandoned to the separatists. It appears the Pakistan Army, following its defeat against the rebels, decided to redeploy its forces to prevent rebels from expanding their operations to nearby provinces, essentially ceding Quetta and its surrounding areas to the BLF. The BLF is said to be jubilant with its victory, announcing plans for exile Baloch leaders to return. Although the Pakistan government remains defiant, there is growing domestic and international pressure for it to swiftly bring the conflict to an end, even with Baluchistan under the control of the BLF."
 Baluchistan_Uprising.37.d:0 "The Baluchistan Liberation Front leaders in Kabul recently flew into Quetta, being triumphantly welcomed by the people and their fighters. The leaders pledged to institute a new government that will look after the people and ensure they prosper from the resources of the province. Despite the jubilant atmosphere, there are also concerns. Many neighborhoods, once homes of retired military personnel and government officials, are emptying as pro-Pakistan refugees continue to stream out of Baluchistan. The Pakistan government continues to insist Baluchistan is in a state of revolt and not an independent state. The people of Baluchistan are left to wonder what the future holds for them under a new regime."
 Baluchistan_Uprising.38.d:0 "Sources with the Pakistan Army privately confirm the military has launched an offensive to finish off the Baloch separatists in Kharan. The military believes it has assembled enough forces to complete their victory. The Baloch leaders in Kabul confirmed new fighting had broken out. It called on all the Baloch people to stand with their fighters to halt what they call a brutal army assault. The Pakistan government is continuing to issue a media blackout over the security situation in Baluchistan, claiming the Army is targeting criminal bands and bringing modernity to the people of Baluchistan."
 Baluchistan_Uprising.39.d:0 "The Pakistan government confirmed its military had successfully defeated the Baloch separatists in the field. Military commanders on the ground report remaining rebels are currently surrounded and incapable of breaking out of their positions. A final capitulation is expected soon. The Baloch leaders in Kabul are said to be despondent over the current situation. For the Pakistan military, the successful operations are a big boost in confidence. Many commanders in the field gained valuable combat experience. The government has pledged to support efforts to bring progress for the people of Baluchistan."
 Baluchistan_Uprising.40.d:0 "Baloch separatists are said to be celebrating their successful resistance to a Pakistan Army offensive. The rebels claim despite facing a ruthless, violent foe, the Baloch people stood up to the ruthless attack. The Pakistan Army and government have refused to comment on reports, stating the situation remains fluid on the ground. Privately, several military officials state many valuable lessons were learned and it is only a matter of time before the Army restores order. The conflict in Baluchistan continues to rage on."
 Baluchistan_Uprising.41.d:0 "In a series of ceremonies, thousands of Baloch separatist fighters handed their weapons to the Pakistan Army. The fighters were granted amnesty and are forgiven for their rebellion against the state. The tribal leaders who led the rebel fighters publicly pledged loyalty to the government. Senior Pakistani military officers oversaw the event, confirming their military victory over the rebels. The Baloch rebels tenaciously fought for independence and to protect the Baloch people from an overbearing central government. The Pakistan government claims its victory represents a step towards progress and modernization for the Baloch people. They claim the traditional tribal elders insist on maintaining an oppressive feudal system. Baloch rebel leaders in Kabul remain in exile, however, some of the leaders are said to be negotiating with Pakistan to return home."
