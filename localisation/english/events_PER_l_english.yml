 iran_political.100.d:0 "Long an advocate for Islamic rule in Iran, Navvab Safavi formed Fada'iyan-e Islam to push for increased fundamentalist reforms into the nation. The government in power would finally have enough of his antics after an attempted assassination on Prime Minister General Fazlollah Zahedi. Safavi was executed by state authorities along with three other allies.\nThe execution marks a dark day for Islamic fundamentalists in Iran, as it becomes clear that secular policies are to stay in Iran."
 iran_political.500.d:0 "A military court sentenced former Iranian Prime Minister Mohammad Mossadegh to death for his treasonous crimes against the government and people of Iran. Shortly after being sentenced, a firing squad carried out the sentence. Mossadegh was alleged to have made a statement that his actions were done for the liberty and honor of the Iranian people before being executed. Opponents of the late Prime Minister will no doubt rejoice over his death. His ability to rally popular support and political influence made him a potent threat to his opponents. For his supporters and allies, there will be great despair over his passing. However, rumors are already reaching Tehran that his network of political allies will likely try to continue his efforts for democratizing Iran and restoring its national honor."
 iran_political.1301.d:0 "Following the failure of Operation Ajax, tension between the Mosaddegh Regime and the Tudeh flared. Fierce Tudeh resistance during Ajax inspired many into the party, swelling their ranks to the point of majority in the nation. Fearing another coup, Mosaddegh would attempt a crackdown on the party. Armed police would attempt to arrest prominent high ranking forces within the Tudehs, including members of the Fifty-Three. Only rallying up the party, Tehran would be swarmed by armed civilians and paramilitary forces. Within two days, Mosaddegh would resign from his position and flee to Turkey. With former leadership gone and Tehran taken, the Socialist Republic of Iran has been declared. Without internal opposition, the move has solidified the power of the Tudeh party.\nIranians across the nation celebrate the victory, with widespread festivals held in support of the move. Islamic Fundamentalists continue to oppose the Tudeh, but lack cohesion or popular support to truly challenge the new regime. For the West, what started as plans to save oil profits have led to a communist Iran in its place."
 iran_political.1298.d:0 "The formerly iconic monarch of Iran who was once greeted with cheers as he moved across the streets of Tehran was now taunted by crowds, rotten fruit barraging the protected convoy he was in. The convoy quickly moved, heading towards the Tehran Supreme Court. Joining Mohammad Reza Pahlavi is his family, Shaban Jafari, Fazlollah Zahedi, and Nematollah Nassiri, all on trial for high treason. Outside the high court, hundreds of Tudeh protests call for the death penalty for all involved. How will the court decide the fates of the now traitors?"
 iran_political.1299.d:0 "The dismantling of the former monarchy continues in Tehran today. The former generals and top advisors for the Shah were recently tried and convicted for charges related from corruption to treason. The trials are being called the Tehran Trials. The treason charges come from the failed countercoup launched to restore the power of the Shah. Many of those convicted are being sentenced to death or long prison terms. The Shah remains abroad in exile and is unlikely to return, especially with so many of his supporters now removed. The United States and its allies, who are accused of supporting the countercoup, are watching the trials closely as there is increasing fear that the new regime is turning towards communism."
 iran_political.1300.d:0 "The tense court hearing of the Tehran Supreme Court was finally decided. Those involved in the coup have been sentenced to death. Outside the courthouse, Tudeh supporters celebrate the announcement calling it a major step towards the end of bourgeoise rule in Iran. Quickly after the announcement, the conspirators were brought 15 miles outside of Tehran and executed by firing squad. Over 280 Conspirators were executed, including the entirety of the Pahlavi Dynasty.\nThe end of an era has hit Iran, as thousands of years of monarchist influence comes to an end. This event will send shockwaves across the future of Iran for generations."
 tudeh.1.d:0 "The Supreme Court of Tehran would come to a decision. Within 48 hours, the Pahlavis and numerous of their accomplices are to be exiled from the country never to return. As Mohammad Reza left the courtroom, aggressive protesters would slam rocks at him and his family. This would be his last memory of Iran, as he quickly was revoked of his citizenship and deported to Saudi Arabia, where he would move to the United States. The former monarch has denied any media interviews and has asked that people respect he and his families' privacy.\nThe end of an era has hit Iran, as thousands of years of monarchist influence comes to an end. This event will send shockwaves across the future of Iran for generations."
 iran_political.1100.d:0 "After months of contemplation, Mohammad Reza Shah would announce his divorce with Queen Soraya due to her infertility to produce an heir. His only child would marry Ardeshir Zahedi, an enemy of the royal family. With this, he denounced both his wife and daughter and remarried to Farah Pahlavi. Many have seen the entire ordeal as corrupt and morally wrong, others seeing it as excusable due to the need for an heir. Either way, the Royal divorce has sparked up further controversy in Iran" 
 phi_events.1.d:0 "Terrible news has struck today in Manila, when former Philippine Senator Benigno \"Ninoy\" Aquino Jr., was assassinated in the tarmac of the Manila International Airport. A staunch critic of President Ferdinand Marcos, Senator Aquino recently arrived in Manila from his self-imposed exile from the United States, escaping the perils and what would be extreme torture and potential death. Upon arriving in Manila, government soldiers were waiting for his arrival, arresting him in the process. However, upon leaving his plane, gunshots were reported and Ninoy Aquino was found dead lying down in the tarmac. Investigation concluded that a communist hitman named Rolando Galman assassinated Aquino, but reports circulate that Galman was merely a scapegoat, and that the assassination was ordered by the Marcos administration. Nevertheless, thousands of Filipinos were mourning Ninoy Aquino's death, and the calls for the resignation of the Marcos regime are louder. Observers point out that this event may be a catalyst of what would be a revolution and overthrow of the Marcos regime, but it is too early to speculate."

 AJAX.101.d:0 "The nationalization of the oil in Iran by the Mosaddegh Regime left the United Kingdom and the United States bitter. Determined to bring back their influence over Iran, the CIA began contact with the Shah, gang leaders, and high ranking military officials to orchestrate a coup. The plan would go array as Mosaddegh heard reports of the coup underway, arresting ringleader Shaban Jafari before the plan could be commenced. With leaked information from the Tudehs and Jafari, Iranian Police would arrest the Pahlavi Royal Family right before they left for their \"vacation\" in Iran's Northern mountains. Without strong leadership from Pahlavi and Jafari, Tudeh and Government forces would easily end any attempts of a coup. Hundreds of suspected orchestrators and foreign agents have been arrested.\nWhat now will happen to Iran is a mystery. Monarchist and Western Influence has been eliminated but the question of how the Mosaddegh Regime and Tudeh Party will respond to the coup may determine the fate of the nation. Is a new power struggle brewing already?"
 AJAX.105.d:0 "Quickly following the failure of Operation Ajax, the remaining mess would see to be solved. The Tudehs would grow in strength due to their impressive efforts in putting down the coup, which would create friction between the Mosaddegh Regime and the communists almost instantly after the ordeal. Instead of dealing with the situation with more conflict, both sides would quickly see the importance of discussion and an official meeting between leaders of both factions would quickly emerge. While having differences in opinions on numerous subjects, both have shown the power they have working together. With this, settlements have been made to keep peace.\nThe Republic of Iran under Mosaddegh remains in power, even with the force of internal forces around it. The fledgling democracy has faced its greatest threat yet, resisting the West and winning."
