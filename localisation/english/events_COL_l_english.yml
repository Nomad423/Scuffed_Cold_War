 COL_pol.1.d:0 "Jorge Elicer Gaitan was the favored liberal candidate, seen as most likely winner in the elections, until he was assassinated today. Riots and looting have broken out, leaving a hundred dead in the chaos in Bogota. Known as the 'The Bogotazo', the conservative government immediately it blamed on Colombian communists. The people of the countryside began to take up arms following the chaos in the Capital, causing a decade long civil-war."

 COL_pol.2.t:0 "Formation of the FARC-EP"
 COL_pol.2.d:0 "In 1964 the Colombian Military attacked Marquetalia, a communist enclave formed during the days of 'La Violencia', filled with peasant guerrila fighters. In retaliation, groups of communist guerrila fighters and independent guerrila fighters sympathetic to the communist cause met together to hold a 'Second Guerrila conference' in 1966. Since this meeting, these guerrillas under influence of PCC members Jacobo Arenas and Manuel Marulanda organized into the FARC. We need to act before they further ignite the fires of civil war in Colombia."
