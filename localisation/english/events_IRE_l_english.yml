 iree.1.d:0 "The general elections are here. This election is the first election since the declaration of the Republic of Ireland on 18 April 1949 under the terms of the Republic of Ireland Act 1948, which automatically forced Ireland's withdrawal from the British Commonwealth. The general election of 1951 is caused by a number of crises within the First Inter-Party Government, most notably the Mother and Child Scheme. There are of course other problems facing the country, such as rising prices and balance-of-payments problems. Two farmer TDs withdrew their support for the government because of rising milk prices. With the ballots closed and votes counted, the people eagerly await the results."
 iree.2.d:0 "The general elections are here. The election of was caused by the loss of an overall majority for the ruling party in the Dáil. Rather than be voted down on a vote in the Dáil, they decided to call a general election and let the people decide."
 iree.3.d:0 "The general elections are here. The election of 1957 was precipitated by the crisis in the trade balance and the government's reaction to it. As a result of this they decided to dissolve the Dáil and let the people decide. The campaign was fought largely over economic issues and the situation in the North. In the north the IRA launched Operation Harvest which drew much popular support in the south. Sinn Féin had been re-built and re-organized as a party by Paddy McLogan and was fielding abstentionist candidates."
 ire.2.d:0 "When World War Two began in 1939 Ireland declared an official State of Emergency on 2nd. September 1939. The Emergency Powers Act was enacted the following day. This gave new powers to the Irish Government for the duration of World War Two. Rationing of food, clothes and petrol was introduced and ration books were introduced to everyone in Ireland. Some of the more important food stuffs that were rationed during and after the war in Ireland were tea, sugar, butter and flour. Bread was rationed in 1942. Tobacco, soap and clothing were rationed aswell. Unlike Britain though eggs and meat were not rationed.\nPetrol was also rationed. The official allowance for ordinary people with cars was eight gallons a month up to 10 hp, 12 gallons a month for cars 10 - 16 hp. Doctors, priests and vets also received an extra allowance.\n\nThe Emergency Powers Act was repealed on 2nd September 1946. Many parts of it were however kept in force, including rationing. Now, after 6 years rationing has officially ended."
 ire.3.d:0 "Through the 1920s and 1930s and 1940s, no purpose-built studio has facilitated year-round filmmaking in Ireland. To rectify this, a business consortium part-funded from the United States, started building a Hollywood-style studio south of Dublin city in 1955. With construction finally complete, Ardmore Studios has opened its doors on [GetDate].\nSituated on a ten-acre site 12 miles south of Dublin, the studio offers the first opportunity for Irish filmmakers to shoot indoors all year round.\nAlready there are rumours that an adaptation of Walter Macken's play, Home Is the Hero, starring Macken and directed by Emmy Award-winning Fielder Cooke is in works as the studios first film.\n\nA representative of the studio gave us this comment: \"Before the studio’s opening, Ireland was confined to location shooting, which would represent only a small part of the completed film. Following the launch of Ardmore Studios - and with Emmet Dalton and Louis Elliman as Managing Directors - international filmmakers will surely begin to view Wicklow as an attractive filming location.\""
