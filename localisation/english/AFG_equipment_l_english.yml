 AFG_infantry_equipment_0_desc:0 "The Lee-Enfield is a bolt-action, magazine-fed, repeating rifle that served as the main firearm used by the British Empire and Commonwealth during the first half of the 20th century. It was the British Army's standard rifle from 1895 to 1957. The rifle saw extensive service throughout the Second World War, especially in the North African, Italian, Pacific and Burmese theatres in the hands of British and Commonwealth forces. Australia and India retained and manufactured the SMLE Mk III* as their standard rifle during the conflict and the rifle remained in Australian military service through the Korean War, until it was replaced by the L1A1 SLR in the late 1950s."

 AFG_infantry_equipment_1_desc:0 "The AK47 is a fully automatic assault rifle developed in the Soviet Union by Mikhail Kalashnikov in 1947, but was not introduced into active service until 1948 where the fixed-stock version was sent in for production. In early 1949, the AK47 was accepted by the Soviet Armed Forces for mass deployment into front-line units. With a long-stroke gas piston, a selector/safety, an automated trigger and chambering mechanism, and further improvements to overall design the AK47 was a vast upgrade to the SKS. The AK47 would, for many years, be considered to be one of the world's most reliable and easy to maintain, handle, and learn weapons in the world."

 AFG_infantry_equipment_2_desc:0 "The AKM is a modernized variant of the AK47 that was developed by Mikhail Kalashnikov that was developed in the late 1950s and put into service with the Soviet Army in 1959. A great deal of the weapon was optimized and redesigned to suit the needs of the modernizing army. Many parts were simplified for mass production and the milled steel receiver was replaced with a u-shaped steel stamping to improve production rates. The weapon was also vastly lighter as a result of the simplifications reducing its weight. by ~30%. Additionally, the weapon was reinforced to make it stronger and added guide rails to improve the bolt carrier's movement. The AKM was immediately and ubiquitously used by many communist countries and manufactured for conflicts during its entire lifespan. Most notably the Invasion of Czechoslovakia, where it was used by both sides."

 AFG_infantry_equipment_3_short:0 "AK-74"
 AFG_infantry_equipment_3_desc:0 "The AK74 is a modern assault rifle developed by Mikhail Kalashnikov to replace the AKM in 1974. It uses a smaller cartridge and an improved chrome-lined bore with 4 right-hand grooves. The front sight and gas block were redesigned to contain a bas channel installed 90 degrees from the bore axis to reduce bullet shear at the port hold. In addition, its development came with a variety of attachments including a rubber padded stock. The AK74's improvements allowed soldiers to carry a greater amount of ammunition in the field and maintain a higher volume of fire at higher mid range accuracies. It saw expensive usage during the Afghanistan conflict where the CIA paid the Mujahideen a great sum of money to retrieve a captured AK74."

 AFG_infantry_equipment_4_desc:0 "The AK-74M is an improved variant of the AK-74 developed in 1991 by the Izhmash factory. The AK-74M was developed to incorporate new materials and manufacturing advances to create an improved weapon. It features a lightened bolt and carrier that reduces the recoil produced by the gas piston. The rifle also includes a glass-filled polyamide stock that can side-hold, an improved muzzle, reinforced cover, and several other minor improvements. It also comes with a rail for mounting optics. The lightened, strengthened rifle was easier to handle and carry and improved support for attachments. It did not see adoption by the Soviet Union as the USSR had crumbled before it could be considered, however, it has been adopted by the Russian Federation."

The T-34 was designed in 1940 by KMBD in the Soviet Union. In an attempt to reduce costs, the sloped armor was introduced into the tank's design. However, this also led to the tank itself becoming far better protected as well as less expensive with a smaller surface area. The weapon itself is 76.2mm gun and had nominal ammunition carrying capacity. However, the sights and vision devices were notably poor making it difficult for tank commanders to operate and their poor coordination capability cut down a lot of the advantages the tank itself provided.

Additionally, the T-55 used the 12.7 DShK HMG more often whereas the T-54 used the 7.62 SGMT gun, granting it more firepower but barring it from carrying more ammunition.

Although an improvement, production was not phased out as its cost was nominally higher than that of the T-55.

Similarity to the famous Lavochkin La-7 was only superficial – the new fighter had an all-metal construction and a laminar flow wing. Weight savings due to elimination of wood from the airframe allowed for greatly improved fuel capacity and four-cannon armament. Mock combat demonstrated that the La-130 was evenly matched with the La-7 but was inferior to the Yakovlev Yak-3 in horizontal planes. The new fighter, officially designated La-9, entered production in August 1946. A total of 1,559 aircraft were built by the end of production in 1948."
