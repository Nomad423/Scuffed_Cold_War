 PRC_Dispute.1.d:0 "The British Raj negotiated its boundaries along the Himalaya's with Tibet and China. Following the takeover of Tibet by the PRC, the new regime decided to void many of these treaties, arguing that the Tibetan government had no legitimacy to negotiate treaties. The Chinese move to develop roads and troop posts in disputed areas led to strong Indian protests and troop deployments. The tensions are focused in Aksai Chin and the North East Frontier Agency. In Aksai Chin a Line of Actual Control (LAC) was established to separate Chinese from Indian forces but recently the Indian Army initiated a Forward Policy. However, the conflict has expanded into a full-on border clash as Chinese forces have begun surrounding some of these posts while the Indian Army appears poised to send troops to secure its posts and disputed clash. As both India and China rush troops to the conflict zone, the world waits to see what will result and whether this border violence will escalate to a broader conflict."
 PRC_Dispute.2.d:0 "The Chinese government announced it had declared a unilateral ceasefire in its conflict with India after it drove Indian forces out of the disputed territories along the Himalayas. From the beginning of the conflict, the Indian Army's Forward Policy in the disputed territories failed to disrupt Chinese forces. Instead, Indian border posts were overwhelmed and Indian forces collapsed in the face of Chinese infiltration tactics. New Delhi has reacted in shock with India's government pleading with Western powers to aid it and prevent a Chinese invasion. Although China appears to have halted its ambitions to just the border areas, India remains apprehensive an escalation could lead to a complete military collapse. Washington and London have both shown equal concern to the communist threat. Observers believe India will likely receive aid to replenish its losses but India's pride has been humbled by its disastrous performance. Military leaders in Pakistan are said to be watching these developments with glee."
 PRC_Dispute.3.d:0 "Since 1945, the People's Liberation Army has appeared almost unstoppable in achieving its objectives. However, following the Chinese government's request for a ceasefire and discussions with India, it has become clear the Indian Army has prevailed in the recent border conflict in the Himalaya's. India will no doubt seek to secure its claims and are likely to succeed as Chinese forces are said to have been driven out of the disputed lands. The Indian Army's Forward Policy has proven to be very successful. Indian forces successfully ambushed Chinese forces in the area and the professional training and leadership was said to have been instrumental in India's success over what Western observers considered a \"peasant army\". Domestically, the Indian government has asserted its strength to its people and have shown the world India did not need to rely on foreign powers to protect itself from its enemies. In Beijing, a lot of soul searching and analysis must be done, though the government has proven successful in suppressing news of the military setbacks to the population."
 SINO_INDIA.10.d:0 "The Indian government's dangerous game of interfering with Tibet and deploying its forces into Chinese territory has been met with a befitting response. The Indian effort to infiltrate our border and seize Tibet resulted in them overstretching their capabilities. Our battle hardened and patriotic forces utilized the lessons we have learned in mountain warfare to overwhelm and destroy the Indian forces in the disputed territory. The professional soldiers of the Indian Army proved they are simple puppets devoted to money, not patriotism and were easily defeated by our forces. Upon securing the disputed territory, we announced a unilateral ceasefire, our forces can secure the territory and we have announced to the world how we have humiliated our enemy. More importantly, enemy propaganda that we are planning a general invasion has proven false. However, considering how successful we have been, we must consider whether we want to continue the fighting into India proper to secure a major revolutionary victory. Or should we stick to our ceasefire and just complete our annexation of Aksai Chin."
 SINO_INDIA.11.d:0 "After heavy fighting with India along our Himalayan border, news has reached us that People's Liberation Army (PLA) forces have been driven out of the disputed territories. The conniving Indian forces had established fortified positions earlier behind our lines in the leadup to the fighting. From these positions the enemy successfully interdicted supply lines and ambushed troops moving through our own territory. Emboldened with their treacherous success, Indian forces surged in support to finish driving us out of the disputed lands. The Indian government announced their forces success in occupying the lands they claimed. The PLA has been humiliated and some commanders are already suggesting the peasant soldier model may not be viable now that China has vast borders to protect. Perhaps more professionalism, along the lines of the Indian Army maybe needed to ensure in future conflicts our forces will be capable of responding to border incidents like this. We will have to sit with the Indian government and listen to their demands for the border, hopefully Tibet will not be compromised by these events."
 SINO_INDIA.12.d:0 "The Chinese aggression began with its seizure of Tibet. The cunning Chinese talked of peace but were acting to seize our lands. From the Himalayas, China would have been poised to plunder our lands but our forces have prevailed. Today, we received a note from the Chinese government asking for a ceasefire to stop the battering of its forces and also asked for immediate discussions on the border. General B.M. Kaul's direction for the Army to engage in a Forward Policy to interdict Chinese infiltrators ended up being a sound strategy. Our professional troops and officers conducted their objectives to perfection. Chinese infiltration efforts were cut off by our forward posts. The Army's assessment that Chinese troops were just armed peasants who could not handle professional soldiers has proven correct. With this victory, we can now dictate the border to its proper dimensions. The Chinese can no longer ignore the treaties or demarcations of the past and more importantly they will have to return the Kashmir lands illegally claimed by them. In New Delhi, jubilant crowds took to the streets chanting 'Jai Hind!' and showering anyone in a military uniform with flowers. Military bases across the nation have received deliveries of sweets from grateful citizens as independent India has demonstrated its status as a major power."
 SINO_INDIA.13.d:0 "The Indian government received a note from the Chinese government that it had declared a unilateral ceasefire in Aksai Chin and the North-East Frontier Agency. Chinese forces secured almost all the disputed territory and Indian resistance had almost completely crumbled in the disputed zone. Our Army's decision to launch a Forward Policy of aggressive patrolling and establishing posts behind Chinese troop positions proved to be poorly conceived. Chinese infiltration tactics successfully isolated and overrun many of these posts. More importantly, Indian troops marched to the Himalayan combat zone in summer uniforms and lacked intelligence. One junior officer bitterly complained his unit had to use local tourist maps as their own maps on the territory was almost worthless. Across India, fears of further Chinese aggression are palpable, while the Indian Army itself must consider some soul searching. Despite this, patriotism remains high. Logistics and specialized training for troops must be a priority and many officers argue the military must evolve its doctrines beyond the World War II experience. Although the Chinese have stopped and achieved their objectives, many in India are holding their breath as they fear further Chinese aggression to take advantage of India's military setbacks. At the very least, we are at the mercy of Chinese wishes in the disputed lands."

 PRC_Dispute.4.d:0 "The woes for the Indian military and government continued as the People's Liberation Army announced it was launching an invasion of India. The PLA says its objective is to liberate the people of India from colonial oppression This marks a dramatic change as the PLA initially portrayed the conflict as a border dispute and Indians now fear waves of Chinese divisions will soon pour out of the Himalayas into the Indian plains. The Indian Army had earlier attempted to dislodge the PLA and secure their claims along its disputed border with China through a policy of establishing small outposts in the disputed lands. In New Delhi an atmosphere of fear is palpable as the government now has ordered the military to redeploy its entire force to face the Chinese threat. However, in other major cities, many Indians have taken to the street to demonstrate their support for the military, many young men have pledged to resist the Chinese." 
 PRC.201.d:0 "Today, according to the report of the guard. \nMao Zedong, former president of the people's Republic of China, died in his hometown of Shaoshan.\nAlthough he made some mistakes, he is still a great leader.\n After delivering an eulogy across the country, Chairman Liu Shaoqi finally announced his decision to cremate his body.In his eulogy, he euphemistically commented on Mao's 'merits and demerits', praised his contribution to the liberation of China, but emphatically criticized Mao's erroneous economic and political policies."
 PRC.202.d:0 "On January 8, 1976, Premier Zhou Enlai, one of the outstanding leaders of the Communist Party of China, died in Beijing. During the two-day farewell ceremony for the body, thousands of people in the capital came to the Monument to the people's Heroes to mourn Zhou Enlai. On both sides of Chang'an Street, people from all walks of life were crowded, and the funeral procession stretched for dozens of miles.\n Flags were flown at half-mast at the United Nations headquarters in New York. After the body was cremated, according to Zhou's wishes, the ashes were scattered in the Miyun Reservoir, the Haihe River in Tianjin and the estuary of the Yellow River."
 PRC.203.d:0 "On July 28, 1976, an earthquake of magnitude 7.8 occurred in Fengnan, Tangshan City, Hebei Province, which lasted for about 23 seconds. Tangshan, an industrial city with a population of one million, has been hit hard. As the earthquake occurred in the early hours of the morning, and the city's transportation, communications, water supply and power supply were interrupted after the earthquake, the rescue was difficult. According to official statistics, the earthquake killed more than 240000 people and seriously injured more than 160000. \nAfter the disaster, the Chinese government immediately dispatched troops and mobilized the people of the whole country to carry out disaster relief activities in Tangshan in an effort to restore industrial and agricultural production and lifeline communications."
 PRC.204.d:0 "Zhu de, member of the standing Committee of the political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and vice president, died in Beijing on July 6, 1976 at the age of 90. His death once again aroused the deep grief and remembrance of the people all over the country after Zhou Enlai,and also dealt a blow to Mao Zedong once again.\nOn July 9 and 10, a condolence ceremony was held for Comrade Zhu de at the working people's Culture Palace in Beijing. On the 11th, a memorial meeting was held in the Great Hall of the people. More than 5000 party and state leaders and representatives of people from all walks of life in the capital attended the memorial meeting. Hua Guofeng delivered an eulogy at the memorial meeting."
 PRC.205.d:0 "After the outbreak of the Zhenbao Island incident in 1969, Sino-Soviet relations dropped to a minimum. On 21 March, Zhou Enlai convened a meeting with Huang Yongsheng, Wu Faxian, Wen Yucheng, and Chen Xilian, commander of the Shenyang military region, and relevant personnel of the Operations Department of the General staff. In view of the situation that the Soviet army might forcibly occupy Zhenbao Island, Zhou Enlai agreed to strengthen our coastal forces and vigorously deploy them in order to wait for work and prepare for a late attack.\nAt the same time, with regard to Kosykin's request to speak to Mao Zedong and Zhou Enlai by carrier phone, the relevant responsible persons of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs were summoned to agree to answer the resuscitation Office in China in the form of a memorandum: 'in terms of the current relations between China and the Soviet Union, it is no longer applicable to contact by telephone. If the Soviet government has anything to say, please formally submit it to the Chinese government through diplomatic channels. ' "
 PRC.206.d:0 "After former presidents Liu Shaoqi and Deng Xiaoping were overthrown as capitalists, Mao Zedong began to look for a sufficiently reliable successor. Taking advantage of this opportunity, Lin Biao, who presided over the day-to-day work of the Central military Commission, began to boast of Mao Zedong, actively participated in political work, placed confidants to various posts and overthrew political enemies. Lin Biao became the only vice chairman of the Central Committee at the Eleventh Plenary session of the eighth CPC Central Committee. It seems that Lin Biao has become the most suitable candidate for president at the Ninth CPC National Congress."
 PRC.207.d:0 "At the Ninth CPC National Congress, Mao Zedong proposed that Lin Biao be elected as the only vice chairman of the Central Committee, and there is no doubt that Lin Biao was designated as the sole heir.\nQuite a number of party officials hold different views on Lin Biao's style of conduct and the result of the election.\nTherefore, as Premier of the State Council, Zhou Enlai's attitude towards Lin Biao is also very important."
 prc.211.d:0 "Although he was designated as the sole heir at the Ninth CPC National Congress, Lin Biao's physical condition became more and more obvious, pressing Mao step by step. \nIn October 1970, with the support of Lin Biao and headed by Lin Liguo, a group of military cadres formed a 'joint fleet' and waited for an opportunity to launch an armed coup."
 prc.212.d:0 "9.The second Plenary session of the Ninth CPC Central Committee I: whether to abolish the National President system\nAfter Liu Shaoqi was overthrown, the job of president was left vacant for a long time. At the second Plenary session of the Ninth CPC Central Committee, Mao Zedong proposed to the Central Committee to amend the Constitution and proposed the abolition of the president. However, due to the realistic consideration of the political operation of the country, most people within the CPC Central Committee still want to retain the post of president and propose Mao Zedong as president, but Mao Zedong still has unshakeable authority.\nWhether or not to abolish the post of president is still open to question."
 prc.213.d:0 "10. The second Plenary session of the Ninth CPC Central Committee II: Three Adverbs\nThe three adverbs 'genius', 'creative' and 'comprehensive' first appeared in the communique of the Eleventh Plenary session of the eighth CPC Central Committee in August 1966. As heir, Lin Biao copied these three adverbs, promoted the 'theory of genius' many times in public, and advocated that Chairman Mao was a rare genius. Mao himself is quite disgusted with these three adverbs and has proposed to delete them many times. However, Wu Faxian insisted on writing the three adverbs evaluating Mao Zedong 'genius, creatively and comprehensively' again in the draft constitution, which deliberately aroused the opposition of Zhang Chunqiao, Kangsheng and others. The development of the contradiction between the two groups has seriously affected the inner-party unity, whether to retain the three adverbs has also become a key decision at the meeting."
 prc.214.d:0 "As the core member of Lin Biao Group, Chen Boda created momentum for Lin Biao on many public occasions. At the second Plenary session of the Ninth CPC Central Committee, as Lin Biao's helper, he repeatedly put forward opposing opinions with Mao Zedong, challenging the authority and testing his bottom line. The pressure exerted on Mao by the Lin Biao clique has made Mao aware of Lin Biao's ambitions. In order to avoid public division within the party, he seems to have used this public criticism of Chen Boda to warn Lin Biao that it is a good choice."
 prc.215.d:0 "The second Plenary session of the Ninth CPC Central Committee ended smoothly. At the meeting, many proposals put forward by Lin Biao were unanimously adopted at the meeting. In accordance with Mao Zedong's opinions, the plenary session criticized Zhang Chunqiao, Kangsheng and others, and ordered the review of Lin Biao's prestige within the party to reach an unprecedented height."
 prc.218.d:0 "After the revelation of Lin Biao's plot to instigate an armed coup, he defected to the Soviet Union on Trident 257 in the early morning of September 13, 1971. However, due to the hasty take-off, at 02:30 in the morning, the plane failed to land on the grassland northeast of Wenduerhan of the people's Republic of Mongolia, killing Lin Biao, Lin Liguo, Ye Qun and other nine people on the spot. Most of the other members of the Lin Biao group were arrested or committed suicide, and the Lin Biao group was declared destroyed.\nAfterwards, in accordance with the instructions of the central authorities, Chinese Ambassador to Mongolia Xu Wenyi and others went to the crash site to inspect the body, buried the body on the spot, and returned home with a large number of photos taken at the scene to report."
