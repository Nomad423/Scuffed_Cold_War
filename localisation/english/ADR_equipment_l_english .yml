 ADR_infantry_equipment_0_desc:0 "An Iconic bolt-action rifle adopted by the Wehrmacht in 1935 as the standard service rifle. It was one of the final developments in the long line of Mauser military rifles. Although supplemented by semi- and fully automatic rifles during World War II, it remained the primary German service rifle until the end of the war in 1945. Despite the growing number of semi-automatic and fully automatic rifles, the Kar98k continues to see use in both sides of the Iron Curtain."

In early 1949, the AK47 was accepted by the Soviet Armed Forces for mass deployment into front-line units. With a long-stroke gas piston, a selector/safety, an automated trigger and chambering mechanism, and further improvements to overall design the AK47 was a vast upgrade to the SKS. The AK47 would, for many years, be considered to be one of the world's most reliable and easy to maintain, handle, and learn weapons in the world."

A great deal of the weapon was optimized and redesigned to suit the needs of the modernizing army. Many parts were simplified for mass production and the milled steel receiver was replaced with a u-shaped steel stamping to improve production rates. The weapon was also vastly lighter as a result of the simplifications reducing its weight. by ~30%. Additionally, the weapon was reinforced to make it stronger and added guide rails to improve the bolt carrier's movement. The AKM was immediately and ubiquitously used by many communist countries and manufactured for conflicts during its entire lifespan. Most notably the Invasion of Czechoslovakia, where it was used by both sides."

The changes consisted in the manufacture of a new stock and forend, made of gray-blue (less often dark brown) plastic. The butt had a characteristic dotted structure. The variant with a folding stock received the MPi AKS-74N variant. The MPi AK-74NK assault rifle was also developed, featuring a shortened barrel."

Additionally, the T-55 used the 12.7 DShK HMG more often whereas the T-54 used the 7.62 SGMT gun, granting it more firepower but barring it from carrying more ammunition.

It was initially commissioned by the Soviet Union in an attempt to improve its firepower and the OKB-520 design bureau finished the project around 1960. Although an improvement, production was not phased out as its cost was nominally higher than that of the T-55. More than 22,700 T-62s were manufactured and it saw vast amounts of combat throughout the Soviet sphere but has seen conflict mostly in the middle east.

It costed almost half as much as the T-64 and came with vast improvements. Its design was finished in 1973 by Leonid Venediktov and showed incredible capability. The gun and armor were still 125mm and composite respectively but with a vastly more economically feasible design that was easier to produce. The engine is a V-12 780 hp that could be later refitted with the a 1130 hp design. The tank could achieve incredible mobility achieving speeds of 80 km/h and could match harsher terrains better than the T-64. It saw usage in all soviet-sphere conflicts, unlike the T-64, and displayed incredible capability in them as well. The tank has also seen plenty of usage in out-of-sphere African, Middle Eastern, and Indochinese conflicts."

It achieved a more robust multi-role capability with enhanced use of air-to-air and air-to-ground high-precision weapons. It also featured a considerably increased combat range, owing to an increase in its internal fuel capacity.[5]A few changes took place during the aircraft's development. The redesigned airframe was constructed from a lightweight Aluminium-lithium alloy to increase the thrust-to-weight ratio. The air intake ramps' geometry was revised, the upper intake louvers were removed to make way for more fuel in the LERXs, mesh screens introduced to prevent foreign object damage (FOD) and inlet dimensions were enlarged for higher airflow."
