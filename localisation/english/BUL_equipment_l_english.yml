 BUL_infantry_equipment_1_desc:0 "The AK47 is a fully automatic assault rifle developed in the Soviet Union by Mikhail Kalashnikov in 1947, but was not introduced into active service until 1948 where the fixed-stock version was sent in for production. In early 1949, the AK47 was accepted by the Soviet Armed Forces for mass deployment into front-line units. With a long-stroke gas piston, a selector/safety, an automated trigger and chambering mechanism, and further improvements to overall design the AK47 was a vast upgrade to the SKS. The AK47 would, for many years, be considered to be one of the world's most reliable and easy to maintain, handle, and learn weapons in the world."

 BUL_infantry_equipment_2_desc:0 "In Bulgaria, the production of Kalashnikov assault rifles (here they were called "automatic carbines") was established in the early 1960s. At first they were assembled from Polish components, in the mid-1960s - independently. The Kalashnikov automatic carbine (AKK) was produced by the state arms factory "Arsenal". Similar to the Soviet AKS, this assault rifle has a folding butt made of steel semicircular rods, which is released by pressing the latch on the left side of the receiver. The part resting on the shoulder is shaped like a horseshoe; rivets are not visible."

Also, since 1999, the Bulgarian company "Arsenal" refused to use the name "Kalashnikov assault rifle" (however, the production of assault rifles was continued under the name AR, and the release of their self-loading versions - under the name SLR). AR-M7 - heavier versions of the AKM chambered for 5.56x45 NATO or 7.62x39 mm (AR-M7F) - with a folding stock, plastic fittings, luminous inserts in the sight."

Additionally, the T-55 used the 12.7 DShK HMG more often whereas the T-54 used the 7.62 SGMT gun, granting it more firepower but barring it from carrying more ammunition.

Although an improvement, production was not phased out as its cost was nominally higher than that of the T-55. More than 22,700 T-62s were manufactured and it saw vast amounts of combat throughout the Soviet sphere but has seen conflict mostly in the middle east.
