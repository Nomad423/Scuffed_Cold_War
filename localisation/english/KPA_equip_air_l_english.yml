 KPA_fighter_equipment_1_short:0 "Yak-3"
 KPA_fighter_equipment_1_desc:0 "The Yakovlev Yak-3 was a single-engine, single-seat World War II Soviet fighter. Robust and easy to maintain, it was much liked by both pilots and ground crew. One of the smallest and lightest combat fighters fielded by any combatant during the war, its high power-to-weight ratio gave it excellent performance and it proved to be a formidable dogfighter."

 KPA_fighter_equipment_2_short:0 "La-7"
 KPA_fighter_equipment_2_desc:0 "The Lavochkin La-7 was a piston-engined single-seat Soviet fighter aircraft developed during World War II by the Lavochkin Design Bureau. It was a development and refinement of the Lavochkin La-5, and the last in a family of aircraft that had begun with the LaGG-1 in 1938."
 KPA_fighter_equipment_3:0 "Lavochkin La-9"
 KPA_fighter_equipment_3_short:0 "La-9"
 KPA_fighter_equipment_3_desc:0 "La-9 represents a further development of the Lavochkin La-126 prototype. The first prototype, designated La-130 was finished in 1946. Similarity to the famous Lavochkin La-7 was only superficial – the new fighter had an all-metal construction and a laminar flow wing. Weight savings due to elimination of wood from the airframe allowed for greatly improved fuel capacity and four-cannon armament. Mock combat demonstrated that the La-130 was evenly matched with the La-7 but was inferior to the Yakovlev Yak-3 in horizontal planes. The new fighter, officially designated La-9, entered production in August 1946. A total of 1,559 aircraft were built by the end of production in 1948."

 KPA_heavy_fighter_equipment_1_desc:0 "The Yak-9 had a cut down rear fuselage with an all-around vision canopy. Its lighter metal structure allowed for an increased fuel load and armament over previous models build from wood. The Yak-9 was manoeuvrable at high-speed at low and medium altitudes and easy to control, which made it one of most produced Soviet fighters of World War II."

 KPA_heavy_fighter_equipment_3_desc:0 "Developed in 1947, after WWII ended, the La-11 was a further development of the La-9 'Fritz' to create a long-range escort fighter. The aircraft was fitted with larger tires to accommodate the increased weight and amenities for long flights such as increased padding in the seat, armrests, and a urinal. In addition, a full radio navigation suite was installed. Not surprisingly, combat performance with a full fuel load suffered. However, as the fuel load approached that of La-9, so did the performance. La-11 pilots in Soviet and later Chinese service would serve in air defense, shooting down American-built Mustangs and attack aircraft during the Korean War. Its NATO reporting name is Fang."
