Burmese nationalists saw the communist demands as too radical and pushing Burma towards global conflict. Fearing a government crackdown, the communists fled their political headquarters and launched an armed struggle. The Burmese military, fearing the communists may unify other regional rebellions, wish to swiftly put down the communist threat.\n\nCurrent Burmese Government Victory Points: [?BRM.Communist_Conflict_Strength]\nCurrent Communist Party of Burma Victory Points: [?BCP.Communist_Conflict_Strength]"

Fearing for their future, the Mon responded by initiating a rebellion against the government. The Burmese military is keen to restore state control over Mon lands.\n\nCurrent Burmese Government Victory Points: [?BRM.Mon_Conflict_Strength]\nCurrent Mon National Liberation Army Victory Points: [?MNL.Mon_Conflict_Strength]"

In return, they received the favor of government employment, especially in the military and police. Following independence, the new government initiated a policy of sidelining Karen military officers and expanding the ranks to the majority Bamar community. The Karen, fearing the government planned to initiate a campaign of suppression to convert the Karen into a second class community, responded by launching its own rebellion.

 arakan_insurgency_options.3.d:0 "A mountain hideout of the so-called Arakan Liberation Army was recently identified by a patrol. The local commander organized an assault force, reconnoitered the enemy camp and launched an assault. The attack was a major success, we inflicted heavy casualties, captured prisoners, weapons, and documents. The commander says the area appears largely pacified at the moment. Hopefully we can build on this success and continue to destroy this anti-state group. Intelligence indicates the enemy is gravely concerned by their setback."
 arakan_insurgency_options.4.d:0 "A unit identified a small base of so-called Arakan Liberation Army fighters. These anti-state miscreants were actively engaged in hostile operations in the area. The unit commander organized an assault group of our soldiers, however, he did not follow sound tactics. He over-estimated his own firepower and underestimated the capabilities of the enemy. Our men ended up being detected on their approach and were ruthlessly ambushed. We took heavy casualties and failed to capture the enemy position or inflict extensive losses. A number of weapons were also abandoned on the field. This is a major setback for our operations in the area."
 arakan_insurgency_options.1.d:0 "The Military Intelligence recently recruited several Arakan villagers to act as agents for us. They went to join the Arakan Liberation Army to learn their tactics and plans. The operation was a major success. Our agents, helped by their training, are quickly rising to positions of authority. They have successfully transmitted valuable data. Our forces are able to effectively respond to enemy movements and have destroyed several bands of rebels. We are preparing further infiltration operations to enable us to achieve total victory."
 arakan_insurgency_options.2.d:0 "The Military Intelligence recently recruited several Arakan villagers to act as agents for us. They went to join the Arakan Liberation Army to learn their tactics and plans. The operation appeared to be a major success. Our agents, helped by their training, are quickly rising to positions of authority. However, the information they passed us led to our own forces falling into ambushes. It is clear some of these agents have betrayed the nation. Some of our other operatives, no doubt loyal, stopped communicating, indicating they were compromised. This is a major reversal, but we cannot stop our efforts."
 arakan_insurgency_options.5.d:0 "The Army informed the Air Force of a major enemy position located in a highly defensible position. A direct assault could succeed, but result in heavy losses. The Air Force planned and organized a mission. Our bombers left an airfield and conducted the attack. We sent a small teem to assess the bombing and they confirmed the strike was a success. The Arakan Liberation Army hastily abandoned the camp, leaving behind destroyed structures and valuable documents. This successful bombing showcases the effective use of air power to support our campaign to destroy anti-state forces in the country."
 arakan_insurgency_options.6.d:0"The Army informed the Air Force of a major enemy position located in a highly defensible position. A direct assault could succeed, but result in heavy losses. The Air Force planned and organized a mission. Our bombers left an airfield and conducted the attack. We sent a small teem to assess the bombing and they were surprised to find a bombed out farmhouse. The position turned out to be a civilian center, and there is no evidence the Arakan Liberation Army was present. The locals are said to be infuriated by the bombing. We will need to reassess how these missions are organized in the future as now the government position in the region has weakened."
 arakan_insurgency_options.10.d:0 "The last truck of Burmese military forces crossed out of Arakan State. As it did, thousands in Arakan went out in celebration as the Arakan Liberation Army successfully drove out the Burmese government. The uprising broke out when it became clear the central government had no intention of providing Arakan State the level of autonomy it sought, pushing many to join the armed uprising. Government forces were not prepared or capable of handling the rebel hit and run tactics. With casualties mounting and popular support for the rebels rising, the Burmese government ordered its forces out. Though the rebels and foreign observers are confirming a rebel victory, the Burmese government has refused to commend."
 arakan_insurgency_options.11.d:0 "The Burmese government released a new series of photos showing Arakan Liberation Army fighters surrendering arms to Army officers. These images encapsulate a successful counterinsurgency campaign which saw the Burmese military degrade and ultimately defeat the Arakan uprising. The rebels and their sympathizers wished an end of colonial rule would see Arakan secure autonomy within the new state. However, when the Burmese government appeared uninterested in offering concessions, this pushed many to take up arms against the government. The military responded swiftly, managing to defeat, uproot, and essentially eliminate the Arakan rebels as a threat."

 rohingya_insurgency_options.3.d:0 "A jungle hideout of Mujahideen fighters was discovered by a patrol. The enemy did not realize they had been exposed. A unit was organized to launch an attack. They managed to reach the enemy camp undetected and launched there assault. The Mujahideen scattered after taking heavy losses. We captured prisoners, arms, and enemy intelligence. This is a major victory for our forces in the area. Our forces are consolidating in the area. The Mujahideen will think twice before trying to face our brave forces."
 rohingya_insurgency_options.4.d:0 "A jungle hideout of Mujahideen fighters was discovered by a patrol. The enemy did not realize they had been exposed. A unit was organized to launch an attack. They managed to reach the enemy camp, however, they had been detected. Our men ended up walking into an enemy ambush. We took heavy casualties as we withdrew. This is a major setback to operations in the area. The Mujahideen will feel emboldened to continue their anti-state operations. Regardless, we will continue the fight for the unity of our nation."
 rohingya_insurgency_options.1.d:0 "From the villages we control in northern Arakan, we launched an intelligence operation to recruit local informants. The Mujahideen are trusting of their own people. As such, these agents can gather information on enemy positions in the area. We can also track their movements. The operation is a major success. Our forces were able to successfully intercept and destroy Mujahideen groups in the area. This is strengthening our control over the area. With more successes like this, we will soon bring this part of the country back to Burma."
 rohingya_insurgency_options.2.d:0 "From the villages we control in northern Arakan, we launched an intelligence operation to recruit local informants. The Mujahideen are trusting of their own people. As such, these agents can gather information on enemy positions in the area. We can also track their movements. The operation ended up being a major failure. Many of the agents actually ended up defecting to the Mujahideen. They provided bogus intelligence and our forces suffered a series of defeats. This is a major setback for our struggle."
 rohingya_insurgency_options.5.d:0 "The Burmese Air Force, using reconnaissance flights, identified a jungle clearing that appears to be a major Mujahideen camp. After intensive planning, our pilots launched a bombing run. They successfully hit their target. A patrol was then dispatched to assess the operation. We found evidence that our bombers destroyed a supply camp, destroying arms and supplies. It also appears the enemy evacuated casualties from the site. In their haste the enemy abandoned valuable intelligence documents. This is a major victory for our Air Force and the nation can be proud of its pilots."
 rohingya_insurgency_options.6.d:0 "The Burmese Air Force, using reconnaissance flights, identified a jungle clearing that appears to be a major Mujahideen camp. After intensive planning, our pilots launched a bombing run. They successfully hit their target. A patrol was then dispatched to assess the operation. Unfortunately, the patrol did not find any evidence of Mujahideen fighters or arms. We had hit an abandoned farmhouse. This is an embarrassment for our pilots and Mujahideen sympathizers are spreading rumors we murdered a family of farmers. The confidence of our pilots is shaken, but we will continue the struggle for uniting the nation."
 rohingya_insurgency_options.10.d:0 "Across Rohingya villages, prayers are being held to commemorate the victory of their Mujahideen fighters over the Burmese military. The conflict began after the Muslims of northern Arakan were denied the right to join the newly established Muslim state of Pakistan. The arrival of Burmese government forces soon after pushed many to take up arms and drive government forces from their areas. After intense fighting, the Burmese military recently decided to withdraw its forces from the area, allowing Mujahideen forces to occupy the territory completely. It appears government forces could not handle the rebels or their ability to blend in and encourage support from local communities. It is unclear whether the Rohingya will seek independence, unification with Pakistan, or autonomy within Burma."
 rohingya_insurgency_options.11.d:0 "In a formal ceremony, disheveled Mujahideen fighters surrendered their weapons to Burmese military officers, confirming their defeat. The Burmese Army successfully and methodically eroded support for the Rohingya rebels and isolated their fighters, enabling success. The Rohingya rebellion began following failed efforts to either secure independence from Burma or unification with Pakistan. Many Rohingya feared the Burmese government will eventually impose a Buddhist regime that would suppress their Islamic practices. The victory brings much confidence to the Burmese government and secures a strategically vital region of the country."
 
 BCP_Conflict.1.d:0 "The nationalist Burmese government sought to crackdown and destroy the communist party. However, its efforts failed as the communists were able to launch a successful military campaign and rally the people to its cause. Following a series of military defeats, the government has surrendered to the Burmese Communist Party. The new government has promised to restore peace across the nation. It plans to initiate a revolutionary socialist program to rapidly bring prosperity to all Burmese peasants and workers."
 BCP_Conflict.2.d:0 "The Burmese Communist Party, after failing to force the government to initiate a radical socialist program, resorted to armed resistance. It sought to seize power through military force and communist tactics. The Burmese military responded to this threat by taking the enemy head on, and after a blistering campaign, has claimed victory over the communists. Despite the victory, there are fears the communists may revive in time, however, the government feels it has demonstrated that armed resistance will only lead to defeat."
 Karen_Conflict.1.d:0 "The Karen National Liberation Army has confirmed the last Burmese troops have left Karen land. This follows its successful operations against Burmese military forces sent to quell the Karen uprising. The Karen, fearing their decline in social status, started an armed rebellion for independence. The Burmese military proved incapable of quelling the uprising, or overcome the defection of Karen soldiers to the Karen cause. The Burmese government now has no way to prevent the Karen from asserting its independence."
 Karen_Conflict.2.d:0 "The Burmese military confirmed it has vanquished the Karen National Liberation Army and now controls Karen completely. The Karen people rose in revolt following their concerns of being removed from their traditional roles in the government and military. When the revolt began, Karen soldiers defected from the Army and World War II veterans joined the rebels. Despite these challenges, the Burmese military managed to wage a methodical campaign to degrade the Karen rebels and reassert Burmese sovereignty. This represents a major victory for Burma."
 Mon_Conflict.1.d:0 "The Mon, long victims of larger powers, has successfully taken control of their destiny after driving out the last Burmese soldiers from their lands. The Mon started their rebellion for independence after the Burmese government refused their request for self-determination. The Mon, fearing an overbearing state could spell their annihilation rose in rebellion. Despite a concerted effort by the Burmese military to restore order, its forces were unable to defeat the Mon rebels. Fearing continued losses, the Burmese decided to withdraw. The path to Mon self-determination and independence appears unstoppable."
 Mon_Conflict.2.d:0 "The Burmese military has restored government authority over Mon State. The Burmese military successfully degraded and destroyed Mon rebel forces, ending their ability to wage armed struggle against the state. For the Burmese government, the victory will allow it to focus on more pressing matters and boost the confidence of its military. Although the Mon have been defeated militarily, its people remain uncomfortable with Burmese rule. Time will tell if the government can assuage these fears or if this was just the first chapter in future conflict."
